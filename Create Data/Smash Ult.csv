Steve ,0,10.474,"Steve is ranked 1st out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the very top in the S+ tier. Steve's ability to create platforms and walls of his own with Mine / Craft / Create Block gifts him with an extremely potent defensive prowess that also grants him great stage control, recovery aid and gimp potential while also allowing him access to a myriad of unique advanced techniques. These blocks also allow him to greatly extend his combos with incredibly fast attacks such as his moving jab attack and axe ladders among others, allowing him to command one of the best advantage states in the game and rack up massive amounts of damage. His damage potential can be further increased by upgrading his toolset with the materials he mines; diamond tools are viewed as a high threat because of it. His back aerial and smash attacks yield incredible kill power, as do his down aerial and TNT, which are notable components in Steve's trapping game. Minecart is not only a useful horizontal recovery tool, but also a projectile command grab, a powerful KO option, and a tool Steve can use to approach opponents. Elytra's gliding mechanics allow Steve to mix up his recovery and can provide him great vertical coverage if angled right. Nearly every move in Steve's arsenal can be used for multiple purposes, such as his down tilt, which can ledgetrap opponents, block projectiles and set up combos. However, Steve is not without weaknesses. His lackluster aerial and ground mobility hamper his approaching options, and his crouch and crawl are ineffective against projectile attacks. Furthermore, his Minecraft-inspired playstyle forces him to constantly mine for materials throughout the match; running out of materials denies him access to certain moves such as Minecart and TNT. Steve's tools will eventually break with extended use, leaving him with an ineffective punch attack unless he uses a crafting table to replenish his tools. He can be denied usage of his crafting table (and his toolset) if he is kept airborne and off-stage, while respawning it forces Steve to use up potentially valuable resources. His up smash and down tilt leave him vulnerable to punish should he miss, and while Steve's tool attacks are fast, they have short reach, making them not as effective as a combo disruptor against other characters. Their short reach also forces Steve to engage in close-quarters combat as he lacks a conventional projectile, where he can easily be outclassed by characters with either ranged or disjointed attacks. Overall, Steve is an incredibly versatile character who is able to manipulate stage terrain to corner opponents, which lets him reap the rewards of an excellent advantage state with massive damage outputs and kill power, on top of already impressive frame data and recovery. Although he has difficulty approaching opponents that outclass him in range, these weaknesses are greatly overshadowed by his strengths and he is considered by many as the best character in Ultimate. He has achieved excellent tournament representation and results from many players, most notably acola and Onin, with the former being considered the best player in the world in 2023. However, due to being perceived as ""broken"" by many in the community, there have been calls to ban the character, especially following the discovery of the Phantom MLG tech in February 2023, which led to temporary Steve bans in many regions, with the technique itself still being banned in some tournaments.","Steve is a fighter who possesses slightly below-average weight and unremarkable mobility. He has the shortest jump out of the entire roster, in addition to a peculiar crouch and crawl based on Minecraft's ""sneaking"" mechanic where he simply hunches over, neither of which are very useful in battle. In addition to this, his walk speed, initial dash, running speed, and air speed are all among the bottom 10 of the respective stats, with his initial dash in particular being the worst in the game.","Taking many attributes from his home game, Steve is one of the most unique fighters on the roster. His battle strategy almost completely revolves around mining materials from the stage itself for several of his attacks, alongside crafting stronger weapons and the ability to place blocks almost everywhere within the fighting boundaries. These three attributes appear as his neutral special, Mine / Craft / Create Block. Mine can take a lot of time to get the desired materials, but Steve starts each stock with a set amount of materials for him to use, so he's not completely defenseless at the start of a fight. Craft is also fast, and in conjunction with the ability to teleport his crafting table to his current position, makes camping Steve's crafting table an ineffective strategy. Create Block is the most potent out of Steve's options and has a myriad of uses; this includes building temporary walls to interrupt opponents, stalling his recovery or his opponent's followups by standing on a floating block making it arguably one of the best recoveries in the entire series, blocking projectiles, mindgames, and extremely deep edgeguarding and gimping opportunities. Steve can even use the short longevity of Create Block to immediately cancel some of the lag in his grounded moves while in the air such as up smash and down smash, leading to some of the most dangerous and diverse aerial combos in the game should he be able to set it up. Create Block is thus one of Steve's essential techniques, though due to the difficulty of building and managing his resources in combat, it can take much experience to truly master. Minecart is a powerful side special: by itself, it is a capable KO option, and can be used as a horizontal recovery tool. Uniquely, Steve can jump out of a moving minecart, turning it into a grabbing projectile that can scoop up a foe, forcing them to struggle out of it. This lets Steve follow up with attacks or edgeguard/gimp recovering opponents. By using up gold and redstone, Steve can use powered rails to accelerate his minecart and catch foes off-guard with the sudden burst of speed. Additionally, he can recover the iron used up from creating the minecart if he is the one to break it afterwards. TNT is Steve's explosive down special, and can be set off from afar by the minecart or by a redstone trail to a wooden pressure plate of Steve's creation, which is extremely useful for ledge trapping. However, it acts as a double-edged sword, as the explosion affects everyone including Steve, and the person who triggers the pressure plate takes reduced knockback from the explosion, which can be used in Steve's advantage for mind games, or against him by a crafty opponent. Additionally, Steve can safely detonate TNT if he uses down smash and properly times a buffered air dodge. Elytra requires no materials on Steve's part to use, has a hitbox upon startup, and its Brawl-like gliding mechanic allows Steve to mix up his recovery path, thwarting attempts at opposing edgeguards. While its horizontal recovery potential is almost unrivaled, it renders him vulnerable after the initial startup. He is also unable to switch directions after using it and will enter free fall if it is angled too high or hits a solid object, making a misinputted or misangled Elytra fatal. Apart from his specials, Steve has noticeable strengths in his other attacks. His neutral attack, forward tilt and neutral aerial all involve a rapid sword swing, but unlike Mega Man's similar attacks, Steve's does not stop until the sword in question breaks, allowing him to continue a chain of sword hits for longer in comparison and set up for combos. This rapid-hit property is also seen in his up tilt and up aerial, which can juggle into various moves. His down-tilt flint and steel is a highly useful edgeguarding tool, as its flames are affected by gravity and can repeatedly block off the ledge for a two-frame punish, in addition to absorbing weak projectiles. In the same vein, down smash has lingering hitboxes on both sides and can be used as a semi-spike, especially in combination with Create Block. Steve's forward and back aerials also possess useful perks, the former possessing meteor smash potential if the opponent is hit near the end of the swing and the latter possessing powerful knockback. While his down aerial costs iron to use, Steve's anvil deals exceptional damage and knockback and can be canceled to avoid falling along with the anvil, making edgeguarding with the move far less risky. It should also be noted that his tool based attacks are further improved with high-tier tools, as gold swings faster and can combo more effectively, while diamond has excellent damage and knockback, especially when using his forward smash, forward air, and back air. Steve's grab game is also respectable. While his tether grab cannot be used to grab the ledge, it can still grab shielded opponents from afar, granting Steve another ranged option to make up for his short-ranged normal attacks. His grab does have a noticable blindspot however, and can be low profiled in certain situations. His back throw angle leaves much to be desired, but his forward throw launches foes in a semi-spike manner and, along with his up throw, have very high base knockback, but average growth, making their KO potential lackluster. His down throw uses iron to slam an anvil on an opponent, dealing very high damage for a throw and sending at a useful angle for followups; however, it becomes incredibly weak without iron, as Steve will simply fling the opponent on the ground. One of Steve's more powerful attributes is how much he can capitalize off of the advantage. Steve is widely agreed upon to have among the best advantage states in the entire game, with a wide range of tools that can lead to large amounts damage fairly easily, and with combos like axe ladders and pick loops, he can preserve the advantage to last even longer. His advantage stage is also uniquely strong at the edge, where he can place traps with TNT and use blocks to hinder certain options like jumping. Steve also has a very unconventional neutral game, which in spite of its passivity can be highly effective; Steve can use Create Block to build walls between himself and his opponent, and hide behind them to mine and upgrade his tools, possibly with gold or diamond. The high threat level of diamond tools means that the opponent is usually forced to approach to prevent Steve from crafting diamond tools, and may have to navigate around or destroy the blocks that may have been placed by Steve, which can be exploited by him to more easily find openings for whiff punishing.","Despite his strengths, Steve's attributes present flaws. His mobility is underwhelming, having among the worst ground mobility in the game due to the combination of poor run speed and the worst initial dash in the game (as opposed to most characters of this speed class usually having relatively high initial dash in contrast to their run speed). His aerial mobility is also unremarkable, having poor air speed and very low jump height, to the point where he's unable to reach the lower platforms of Battlefield without burning his double jump. Finally, despite being relatively short compared to an average humanoid character, Steve's crouch and crawl barely reduce his height and his hitstun animations leave him in an upright position, preventing him from ducking under attacks and leaves him vulnerable to being attacked. His moveset has its own downsides. His down tilt and up smash leave Steve stuck until the animation is finished, making him open to a punish from the sides. While many of his core moves (such as his sword and axe moves) are very spammable, they only cover a very short distance and do not cover below or behind him, leaving Steve without a useful ""get-off-me"" option against combo-centric opponents, excluding using iron to summon an anvil or building a block to stall his fall, which are only effective with enough iron and within the stage's build limit, respectively. Additionally, the spammability of his moves are held back by Steve's low mobility, making it unwieldy for him to attempt rushdown tactics. His grab's range is offset by its very high ending lag, making his grab game less effective against mobile fighters, and his down throw is significantly less damaging and effective without iron. Steve's Minecraft-inspired playstyle can also leave him in troublesome situations. If he mines more materials than his inventory can fit, he will end up discarding resources that might have otherwise been valuable. This negatively affects Create Block, as it always prioritizes the weakest block first; weak blocks can be broken very easily by hitting them with attacks or hitting the bottom side of the block, making them less effective for edgeguarding or creating a blockade. Additionally, walling off a recovering opponent may not be an effective option, as damaging hitboxes can easily plow through weaker blocks without much trouble, and hitting Steve (or placing them near the build limit) will cause his blocks to break significantly faster. His tools can break if used up enough, forcing him to mine to collect materials and craft to re-upgrade them. Furthermore, getting KO'd results in Steve's tools reverting to wood (though he keeps resources already in his inventory), and mining for materials/crafting new tools can be difficult against faster opponents, who can constantly pressure Steve and deter him from gaining resources. His reliance on materials for the majority of his strongest techniques prevents him from repeatedly using them to a greater extent, due to the glaring downsides of running out of a specific material (ex. his down air and down throw accomplishing nothing with a lack of iron). Careless use of his resources will essentially leave him with almost no useful abilities: the time needed to mine can become very detrimental when fully depleted of resources, or when barehanded/using wooden or stone tools, as it takes a significant amount of time to fully replenish resources or dig for gold/diamond. His lack of a conventional projectile and short attacking range demands he gets in close to dish out damage, upon which fighters more suited for close combat than Steve can leave him constantly juggled. Steve's recovery, while having amazing horizontal and vertical reach, is also limited in some ways due to his low jump height and airspeed. Elytra takes some experience to get used to, as its mechanics can make it difficult to angle, and it can also be cut short if he bumps into an object. Minecart can be used for horizontal distance, though it does not grant good distance without gold, and cannot be used without iron. (Although Powered Minecart also uses up redstone, it and TNT use so little that running out of redstone never happens without specific setup to do so.) His blocks cannot be placed too far out from the edges of the stage, and the block Steve is standing on deteriorates faster than normal, which can limit his ability to stall offstage due to him requiring materials. TNT can be used in niche situations since it gives Steve a slight vertical boost when dropped in the air, but it's usually not recommended due to its extreme resource cost. ","Overall, Steve excels in a strange combination of close-up fighting, stage control, and fearsome edgeguarding, resulting in a large learning curve for players eager to pick him up. His toolkit gives him powerful overall abilities when mastered, some of which are not possessed by any other fighter in the roster; however, poor use of his resources can render him almost helpless and remove some of his best options, and his terrible mobility, compounded by a reliance on fairly linear options for approaching, means he faces an uphill battle against characters that outrange him, or are fast enough to weave around his defenses."
Sonic,0,10.315,"Sonic is currently ranked 2nd out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, sharing the S+ tier alongside Steve. This is a slight improvement from his 7th/8th out of 54 placement in Smash 4 (where he was tied with Fox), makes him the highest ranking base-game character, and marks his best placement in the series. Sonic's biggest strength is his speed, which allows him to utilize a hit-and-run playstyle. Complementing this speed is his massive array of burst options with a wide window of unreactable range thanks to moves like Spin Charge and Spin Dash, which are regarded as some of the best neutral options in the game. This grants Sonic unparalleled mobility over the stage as he is able to weave around enemy defenses, bait out approaches, and control the overall pace of the game. In addition, Sonic can also play offensively, as his speed allows him to chase opponents across the entire stage while his great recovery also allows him to place pressure on the opponents offstage. All of this allows Sonic to rack up damage fast while keeping damage done towards him at a minimum. However, Sonic has some noteworthy flaws, most notably his KO potential. Many of his best KO moves either require proper positioning to be most effective or have noticeable starting and ending lag; this can lead to opponents surviving up to high percents if Sonic is unable to secure an early KO. In addition, some of Sonic's moves, such as Spin Charge and his up aerial, can occasionally have trouble connecting, which can render situations where the opponent may inadvertently escape one of his combos. Lastly, Sonicâ€™s endurance has been decreased noticeably from his previous incarnation making him more prone to getting KOed. Overall, Sonic is a character that can rack up damage fast and pressure opponents both on and offstage. However, he can often have a tough time closing out stocks if his opponents space him effectively. While initial impressions on Sonic were rather lukewarm, it has since improved dramatically following the online era and the changes to the metagame. Sonic has since seen competitive success thanks to the efforts of KEN and Sonix, and he is widely considered to be one of the best characters in the game, if not the best.","Sonic is a lightweight who, staying true to his home series, has outstanding mobility. He unsurprisingly possesses the fastest dashing speed in the game by default (which is surpassed only by Hero while using Acceleratle), the 7th fastest walking speed, the 12th fastest air speed (which tied with Mario, Donkey Kong, Little Mac, and Inkling), and the highest traction in the game (surpassed only by Winged Form Sephiroth). When combined with his above-average falling speed and jump heights, these attributes allow Sonic to move across the stage at a blisteringly quick pace, even in spite of his average gravity and low air acceleration. To round out his attributes, Sonic is also capable of wall jumping.","Sonic's special moves are quite useful. Spin Dash and Spin Charge allow him to travel across stages at varying speeds, inflict damage on contact, and follow up into an aerial attack or uncharged Homing Attack. Despite appearing very similar aesthetically and mechanically, they both have different strengths and uses for various different situations. Spin Dash allows Sonic to jump around the stage while charging or holding the charge of the move and can be released in the air, and the hop at the start of the move allows Sonic to ""spin shot"" on ground as well as in the air, with it being the side special making it more ideal for aiming the spin shot to recover. The initial jump can also help Sonic avoid certain things like projectiles by hopping over them, it, however, loses this initial hop if fully charged. Spin Dash also has a moment of intangibility on startup, which can bypass even Wonderwing. The intangible fully charged version can pass through most grounded attacks but will clank with projectiles and aerial attacks. The non-fully charged version with the hop though can bypass if not beat out almost anything due to being aerial. The fully charged version of Spin Dash will also be intangible whenever Sonic turns the move around. Due to the number of branching choices Sonic has when starting Spin Dash, it is his most reliable attack in neutral and one of his best approach options overall. From jumping into cancellation, charging it to alter its timing, switching directions after releasing, and utilizing the spin shot, Spin Dash plays an extremely important role when attempting to play mind games versus Sonic's opponent. While Spin Dash is a one-hit move that mostly knocks opponents into the air, Spin Charge, on the other hand, hits multiple times, carrying the opponent, and moves a little faster, making it a good alternative for dashing. Jumping out of Spin Charge also has Sonic hop while spinning, making him a jumping hitbox. Also, due to charging up by pushing the Special Move button repeatedly, it can be charged up to full power faster than Spin Dash. Spin Charge can also perform a ""spin shot"", although it can only be done while airborne and can't be reversed. Both give Sonic additional protection when recovering and combo into other moves. The mobility of both in tandem with Sonic's already impressive speed makes him capable of quickly adding on damage to unprepared opponents from anywhere on the stage, and they can clank and cancel out the effects of certain moves (such as C4 or Egg Roll). Both moves also have Sonic's hurtbox extend beyond the attack's hitbox. Both moves can be blocked by shield, making them a bit unsafe and committal or predictable, as Spin Dash can only be canceled with a jump and Spin Charge can only be canceled by jumping or stopping pressing the Special Move button. However, they can bypass shields if fully-charged and jump over them on initial contact. Homing Attack deals a varying amount of damage, homes in on the nearest opponent and is good for punishing laggy moves and edge-guard breaking. Its uncharged state also has the potential to combo and its charged state has a small amount of KO potential at higher percentages. Spring Jump is a useful recovery that grants intangibility at the start, goes very high, and is one of few recovery moves that do not cause a helpless state, enabling Sonic to attack and dodge during his descent and even extend his recovery with a directional air dodge. The spring that is dropped can be useful both on-stage and off-stage by allowing him to pressure and gimp opponents, respectively. Sonic also has a powerful air game. Neutral aerial is a great combo starter when SHFF'd, as a result of its long-lasting hitbox, low landing lag, and launching angle. Forward aerial is useful for edge-guarding and, in certain instances, it can combo into itself on-stage at low percentages thanks to its generous auto-cancel window and Sonic's fast air speed. Up aerial's auto-canceling window makes it a useful and deceptively safe combo starter when SHFF'd. Back aerial's clean hitbox is very powerful, to the point that it is one of Sonic's most reliable KO options. Lastly, down aerial is a stall-then-fall that has noticeably less ending lag compared to other stall-then-falls. When coupled with its initial hitbox's ability to meteor smash airborne opponents, down aerial can potentially gimp an opponent, if not KO them outright, and yet still allow Sonic to recover immediately afterward, even if he misses. Sonic's neutral attack, tilt attacks, and throws have mediocre damage outputs, yet their quick speed can make them difficult to punish. His grab game is decent overall: while none of Sonic's grabs excel in speed and each of them have average ranges, they are still fairly easy to land thanks to his outstanding mobility. Sonic's pummel is also quick and has an average damage output, allowing him to rack up a fair amount of damage before throwing an opponent. Down throw is a semi-spike that has high base knockback, which makes it excellent for setting up edge-guards and tech-chases. Back throw also has high base knockback and KOs much earlier than his other throws, especially if it is used while near the edge. It also moves Sonic backward, which makes it useful for setting up an immediate edge-guard attempt. Up tilt can be reversed on startup and hit opponents through platforms above Sonic, and his forward smash has a bit of a deceptively large range due to him stepping forward during the punch. Up throw is a reliable combo starter, having decently damaging combos beginning at 0%, as well as Spring Jump-assisted aerial combos beginning at medium percentages. It also has KO potential, although it only KOs reliably at very high percentages when used on high platforms, such as Battlefield's top platform, as well as stages with low upper blast zones. Lastly, forward throw is his least useful throw, as its primary utility is for forcing the opponent away from him and setting up an edge-guard. Mastering Sonic's running game is crucial to Sonic's ability to perform at high-level play; thanks to Sonic having the fastest dashing speed, Sonic mains can take advantage of a variety of dash or dash-related techniques. Dash-dancing is extremely useful for mindgames, such as by running in one direction and then quickly turning the other way around to bait an opponent or catch them off-guard. The ability to use any attack out of a dash further compliments this strategy, as Sonic can retaliate almost immediately to an opponent's attack after dash-dancing. As such, it is often regarded by Sonic players that it is better to run away from the opponent and run back than to use rolls to avoid opponents. This allows the player to avoid damage, not be as easily punished, have more control over their actions, and be able to punish their opponent's attacks. Dash-dance pivots (consisting of fox-trotting away from the opponent, then quickly dash-dancing backward) are particularly effective for this, as they can cause almost immediate turnarounds and allow for easy grabs. In general, Sonic arguably has the easiest time winning the neutral game due to his unmatched speed and maneuverability on-stage, and attacks that not only come out fast but can also be used to approach with.","Despite the plethora of strengths, Sonic has some weaknesses however, the most noticeable being his KO potential. It is held back by his best KO moves (his smash attacks and clean back aerial) requiring good positioning and having noticeable startup and ending lag. His forward and up smashes are also burdened with low base knockback, which forces them to be used for KO attempts later instead of earlier, and his down smash, although it has decent startup, has high ending lag, making it easy to punish if missed. While Sonic's damage-racking ability is formidable, his ability to reliably close out stocks is among the worst in the game, which oftentimes results in his opponents surviving beyond 150% and even 200% if he is unable to score an early kill, forcing him to rely on hard reads in order to reliably take stocks at high percents. Despite his outstanding mobility, Sonic may struggle to land due to his very low air acceleration, leaving him susceptible to juggling. Sonic can also have difficulty dealing with camping, since any ground-level projectile can severely limit his movement options. While Homing Attack and Spin Dash are his best options in getting through said projectiles, they can be reacted to and even predicted. Some of his attacks are also very punishable should they miss, and thus allow openings for opponents to punish him. Homing Attack can miss if his opponent is moving too fast or is in the middle of an attack when Sonic releases the move. His recovery is also predictable with Spring Jump as his only vertical recovery option, as its linearity makes him susceptible to gimps even at relatively low percentages. Finally, Sonic can be susceptible to early KOs due to being a lightweight.","In all, Sonic has a great offensive play, a strong neutral game, a good off-stage presence, and can very rapidly damage his opponents. However, like other characters of his archetype, he has some trouble KOing and can be difficult to keep track of, even for the player using him, which sometimes leads to accidentally putting him at a disadvantage or even inadvertently self-destructing. Although Sonic's attributes make him a hit-and-run character most of the time, his prowess for using mindgames and switching up tactics encourage multiple playstyles to succeed, which give him a higher learning curve but allows him to match up well against nearly every character in the cast."
Mr Game & Watch,1,9.784,"Mr. Game & Watch is ranked 3rd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the top of the S tier. This is a drastic improvement from his placement in Smash 4 where he was ranked 38th out of 54, and is his best placement in the series. Mr. Game & Watch's most notable strength is his unrivaled out of shield game: Fire is arguably the most effective out of shield option in the game, as it possesses quick startup at frame 3, with large hitboxes that are positioned on both sides of Mr. Game & Watch, allowing him to effectively punish moves that are the slightest bit mis-spaced. In addition, Mr. Game & Watch also possesses a strong combo game rooted from his baiting and punishing with up special, into multiple follow up hits such as his highly damaging up aerial, which also serves as an amazing juggling tool. Complimenting his combo game is his KO potential, with very strong tilt attacks, as well as smash attacks that are safe on shield due to their low ending lag. His ledgetrapping is also among the best in the game, with an indefinite attack in the form of Chef, which significantly complicates an opponent's ability to get back on stage and gives Mr. Game & Watch edgeguarding and gimping opportunities. Finally, Oil Panic allows Mr. Game & Watch to deal with zoners and projectile users, as it acts as both a reflector and an absorption based move, and if fully charged, can be released on an opponent for a KO. However, Mr. Game & Watch possesses some notable weaknesses, the most significant being his extremely poor endurance. He is tied with Squirtle for being the third lightest character in the game, making him susceptible to early KOs. Aside from up special and down aerial, most of his defensive options are underwhelming, as his other aerials are slow, his double jump is floaty, and his rolls and dodges are short-reaching. Finally, his neutral game lacks effective zoning options while his attacks have very short range outside of a few disjointed attacks, and as such he has a poor approach game and has more trouble fighting against sword characters and characters with better disjoints. Overall, Mr. Game & Watch fits the archetype of a glass cannon. He is a character that can deal out damage quickly, has several strong KO options, and can be annoying to properly hit due to spammable attacks and a strong out-of-shield game. However, his weak endurance and poor approach options mean he has to play patiently, lest he gets KOd before the opponent. Although still underwhelming compared to other characters in his tier, Mr. Game & Watch's representation has nevertheless been strong for most of the game's lifespan, thanks to the efforts of players such as Maister and Miya.","Mr. Game & Watch is a short, lightweight character that has some typical attributes of characters in his weight class, and is also a character of extremes. He has fast air speed, excellent air acceleration, a small size, and a very low crouch that allows him to evade many attacks like Marth's Shield Breaker and Simon's forward tilt. However, his jumps are very low and he has slightly above-average walking speed and below-average running speeds although his initial dash is decently fast.","Unlike most other lightweights, Mr. Game & Watch possesses attacks with large disjointed hitboxes and has numerous, powerful KO options. All of his smash attacks have very high power and low ending lag throughout, with each of them possessing unique attributes. Forward smash is among the strongest in the game if sweetspotted while having low endlag and good range, with the sweetspot being safe on shield. Up smash is also very strong, and comes with full body invincibility while the hitboxes are active. While it has slow startup, it has minimal endlag and is completely safe on shield. Down smash sends opponents at an awkward semi-spike angle offstage, while its sweetspot buries opponents long enough to lead into a forward smash, even at medium percents. It also has a very large hitbox, allowing it to easily 2-frame many recoveries, and acts as an excellent punish option on rolls. Like his other smash attacks, down smash is safe on shield when spaced properly. Overall, Mr. Game & Watch possesses an excellent arsenal of smash attacks. Outside of his smash attacks, Mr. Game & Watch's other moves also boast strong KO potential. Forward tilt comes out quickly, has a lingering hitbox, and kills under 120% by the ledge, sending characters at a semi-spike. Down tilt lowers Mr. Game & Watch's hurtbox to match his crouch, allowing him to whiff-punish certain attacks. It also possesses high power and semi-spikes opponents offstage, leading to edgeguards and killing outright at 100%. His new forward aerial's explosion kills opponents at 120% by the ledge, while his back aerial now sends at a flatter angle with enough power to KO below 100% offstage. The clean hit on down aerial boasts a powerful meteor smash that can KO below 40%, while the late hit deals enough knockback to KO under 130%, and even sooner if it connects near the top blast zone, courtesy of the move's vertical launch angle. The move's low ending lag allows as to be used as a potent edgeguarding and landing option, giving him a deadly mixup game in the air at all times. Oil Panic is used as Mr. Game & Watch's primary defense against camping and projectiles, as it both absorbs energy projectiles from moves such as Mega Buster and PK Fire, and reflects items like King K. Rool's Blunderbuss and Peach's Turnips. This can lead to massive advantages against certain characters who rely on projectiles in their playstyle. Oil Panic also has the notable ability of carrying over the charge to subsequent stocks, which can be used as a lethal finisher and even mind games. The area in which Oil Panic can absorb projectiles is also deceptively large, which allows Mr. Game & Watch to store energy into Oil Panic merely by standing close to just the edge of any energy projectile. Finally, Oil Panic is also a potent combo finisher with nearly instantaneous startup lag, with its fairly large, lingering hitbox coming out on just frame 2, as well as extreme knockback that can kill at single digit percents when at max power (power is dependent on projectiles absorbed). It is also notably difficult to defend against a fully charged use of it, as the lingering hitbox can still hit spot dodges if timed even slightly off, and a powerful enough charge can break a full shield, allowing Mr. Game & Watch to punish with one of his powerful smash attacks. However, Oil Panic has the glaring weakness of being filled with extremely weak moves such as Fox's blaster. This causes Mr. Game & Watch to fill Oil Panic extremely quickly, rendering its defensive value useless, and forces him to either hold onto a weak use of it, or dump it without purposefully damaging the opponent in order to use it again as a defensive tool. In addition, a full Oil Panic cannot absorb or reflect any projectiles, making Mr. Game & Watch more vulnerable to projectiles unless he releases the oil spill. Mr. Game & Watch also has a very potent combo and aerial juggling game. Down throw combos into Oil Panic, Judge, and neutral air at low percentages. Chef can deal massive damage if multiple 'food' items hit, allowing it to get around 30-40% off of a single edgeguard. The pan also hits opponents into the stream of meat through a semi-spike, and at high percents can launch opponents fast enough to miss the food entirely and lead to more ledge trapping. Chef's speed and pattern makes it extremely difficult for certain characters to recover, such as Ganondorf or Mario. Not only does Chef deal massive damage, but landing the move allows Mr. Game & Watch to follow up with a grab, neutral aerial, forward tilt, dash attack, and even Judge. Up tilt, though having worse range, deals high damage and combos into neutral aerial and Judge at low percentages. Once Mr. Game & Watch has his opponents above him, he can juggle them for massive damage using his up and neutral aerials. His up air acts similar to Mega Man's up air, pushing opponents upwards, albeit with much less force. All in all, Mr. Game & Watch's strong KO power is also paired with highly damaging combos and juggles. Lastly, Mr. Game & Watch possesses a fantastic recovery option, as well as large, long-lasting and disjointed aerials. This means that he is a formidable edgeguarder and is extremely hard to gimp himself. His up special, Fire, has frame 3 startup, invincibility in its early frames, impressive recovery distance vertically and horizontally, and a strong upwards hitbox on its initial hitbox, with decent launch power horizontally, allowing for early off-stage KOs if it hits opposite the blast zone. This makes it deadly, as it can stage spike unwary opponents while also easily gimping characters with poor recoveries, like Chrom. It is also an extremely useful combo breaker and the game's uncontested best out-of-shield option due to its fast startup and invincibility, which is further complemented by it not rendering him helpless. His back aerial, Turtle Bridge, is a large, long-lasting disjointed multi-hit move that has high knockback at the final hit. The move's large disjoint beats out a lot of recoveries that have hitboxes, and the multi-hit nature of the move makes it hard to tech for stage-spikes and often drags opponents stuck in the move closer to the blast zone. For many characters, getting hit with Turtle Bridge is often fatal off-stage, as the move lingers long enough to shift the opponent closer to the blast zone before dealing the final knockback on the last hit. On the ledge, Chef punishes ledge hangers and covers getup attack and rolls (hit by the pan), forcing opponents to jump. This can easily allow Mr. Game & Watch to follow up with neutral aerial and force the opponent back off-stage. His new forward aerial can be comboed into with Chef and has strong KO potential on its own. Lastly, his up air has the notable quality of having no set limit on its distance, making it arguably the best juggling option in the game. Overall, Mr. Game & Watch is extremely deadly off the stage and at the ledge to all characters, even including himself.","Despite these strengths, Mr. Game & Watch possesses a few notable weaknesses. He is tied with Squirtle being the third lightest character in the game, which, along with his floaty movement and average speed, make his horizontal and vertical endurance terrible. In addition, despite having disjointed hitboxes, his overall range is mediocre. This is worsened by the fact that many of his disjointed moves like down tilt, up tilt, and forward smash have underwhelming range for a disjoint. Characters with swords like Marth and Cloud are able to easily keep Mr. Game & Watch at arm's length and stop his approaches. Also, while his new forward air possesses more damage and knockback, it has very low priority, so any move can hit the bomb and make it disappear. This makes it unsuitable for approaching and forces Mr. Game & Watch to approach with his back air instead. It is also a much more situational move in general, due to its higher lag and delayed hitbox, as the bomb will only explode upon touching the ground or waiting for half a second. Also, none of his aerials can autocancel in a short hop. Due to this, he has a somewhat lackluster neutral game and a rather poor approach. While Mr. Game & Watch's down throw and up throw are good at starting combos, Mr. Game & Watch's throws don't KO until very high percents, with his strongest throw, down throw, KOing at around 200%. He also has mediocre defensive attributes, possessing slow and short-reaching spot dodges and rolls. All in all, Mr. Game & Watch is a very powerful glass cannon with unique properties to a majority of his moves, and is universally believed to be among the most potent glass cannon characters in the game. He possesses extremely high damage output and powerful KO options while being very vulnerable himself, but is compensated for his extremely light weight and mediocre approach and defensive options with an incredible recovery, a brutal combo and juggling game, great edgeguarding, oppressive offstage presence, and explosive power through his smash attacks and Oil Panic. ","Overall, his strengths considerably outweigh his weaknesses, making Mr. Game & Watch one of the most fragile characters, but also among the most oppressive in all of Ultimate."
Snake,1,9.689,"Snake currently ranks 4th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing him in the middle of S tier. This is a marginal improvement from his placement in Brawl, where he was ranked 6th out of 38. He is gifted with an exceptionally versatile moveset, having a wide variety of powerful tools at his disposal, including fast startup on the majority of his attacks, large, disjointed hitboxes on many of his moves, high damage and knockback output, one of the game's best burst options with his dash attack, an excellent projectile and camping game with his many explosives, a great tech-chasing and setup move with his down throw, a fast and highly damaging out of shield option with his down aerial, and fantastic stage control, ledge trapping and edgeguarding capabilities. His grenades are one of the best projectiles in the game due to their frame 1 startup, making them excellent combo breakers and setup tools, and their ability to be shield dropped and subsequently picked up gives them vast utility for both offense and defense in battle. They can also be B-reversed to help Snake mix up his landing, and his heavyweight status gives him strong endurance, while also allowing him to make use of rage. His up tilt remains an extremely lethal KO move due to its decently sized hitbox, as well as its sheer speed and power. Snake inherits several flaws that were endemic to him in Brawl. His main issue is his recovery; despite the high distance Cypher provides, it remains predictable and easy to intercept, which is now made worse by it being able to be destroyed, and his slow-acting air speed makes him susceptible to gimping, despite the benefits of the game's air dodge mechanics. While he has several tools like C4 to refresh his recovery and grenades to break out of combos, he's often forced to self-inflict damage just to recover or reset into neutral, which combined with his susceptibility to combos, trouble landing, and the inability to tech at very high percentages, gives him a very poor disadvantage state. Although several of his attacks having fast startup, many of his moves have notable end lag, which can leave him vulnerable on block. The removal of DACUS, of which he was previously one of its most proficient users, has also limited his mobility options to an extent. Additionally, due to his explosives being able to be absorbed, this can give him trouble against characters with absorption based moves. Finally, Snake's KO options are all fairly predictable. Since many of his kill moves like smash attacks are slow acting, he's often times limited to attacks like up tilt that are easy to anticipate, since many of his KO setups are a lot more circumstantial. Nonetheless, his pros greatly outweigh his cons. Since the release of the game, Snake has consistently been one of the most popular characters in competitive play, with many players representing him throughout the years, most notably Hurt, ApolloKage, and MVD.","Snake is a tall heavyweight character, being tied with R.O.B. and Banjo & Kazooie as the 18th heaviest character. Much like several other heavyweight zoners, Snake has poor overall mobility; while he has above-average traction, falling speed, and fast falling speed, his dashing speed, initial dash, walk speed, air speed, and gravity are all below-average, his jumps are among the lowest in the game, and he is also tied with Simon and Richter for the lowest air acceleration in the game. As a result of his mobility, Snake is highly reliant on zoning and trapping with his projectiles in the neutral.","One of Snake's biggest strengths is his moveset: similarly to a few other characters, such as Young Link, the overall utility provided by Snake's moveset is so considerable that he lacks a single ""bad"" or ""useless"" move. An example of this would be his ground game. His neutral attack comes out quickly and is a good anti-pressure tool with good mixup potential. His forward tilt is a 2-hit attack with fast start-up (frame 4) and a decently sized hitbox. It also has high knockback, allowing it to KO at high percents. His up tilt is often considered one of the best in the game due to its deceptively fast start-up (frame 6), very strong KO power, and disjointed hitbox. It is also infamous for being able to be confirmed into by his down throw, which is a true combo at high percents (around 160%). His down tilt is one of his best poking tools, having fast speed (frame 6) and a great disjoint that goes beyond Snake's feet. It also puts Snake into his crouch position on the first frame of the move, making it a great way to evade certain attacks. Lastly, his dash attack comes out very quickly (frame 5) and is a useful approaching option due to its good knockback which even allows it KO at the ledge at very high percents, while it also crosses shields, grants Snake arm intangibility, and has a reasonable amount of ending lag, giving him one of the game's best burst options and making it arguably the best dash attack in the game. Snake's smash attacks offer a unique set of options. His up smash shoots a missile upwards and the height at which it travels can be increased by charging the move. This makes it great for edgeguarding, ledgetrapping, and as an anti-air. The launcher also has a hitbox that comes out on frame 11. His forward smash, while extremely slow, is incredibly strong and is decently safe on shield due to its relatively low endlag and large hitbox, making it great for hard reads or if the opponent rolls in Snake's direction. Its large hitbox also reaches beyond the ledge and allows it to 2 frame punish opponents. His down smash is fast, has good KO power (especially with the back hit), possesses a disjointed hitbox on both hits that goes beyond Snake's feet and makes it a good tool for 2-framing and edgeguarding, and is relatively safe on shield if its back hit connects. While Snake's air attributes are poor, his aerials by themselves have lots of utility. Neutral aerial is strong and deals very high damage, making it great for edgeguarding and as a follow up move out of Snake's explosives. Its first three hits can also setup into other moves if Snake lands as quickly as possible after connecting one of the hits. Forward aerial is a very powerful meteor smash with great horizontal and vertical range. Down aerial is often considered Snake's best aerial, as it comes out very quickly (frame 3), has decent range and knockback, and deals high damage, with all the hits combined dealing 20% in a short hop. The move also gives Snake a small vertical boost in the air and autocancels in a short hop. Due to its aforementioned speed, it is useful for racking up damage and is a very effective out of shield option. Up aerial is relatively quick, has strong vertical power, and a large disjointed hitbox that extends far beyond Snake's legs. Finally, back aerial is fast, deals high damage with powerful knockback, and has long disjointed range along with a high amount of active frames, making it a reliable landing option and a way to escape juggles as well as a potential KO move. Snake's grab game is also fairly versatile. His dash grab goes a surprisingly long distance thanks to him sliding forward during it. His throws, however, are where his grab game shines. Down throw is unique in that it has the down effect: while this makes it unsafe at low percents, as the opponent can react before he can, it gains enough hitstun at high percents to allow Snake to follow up reliably, with up tilt being renowned as a guaranteed KO confirm at 160%. It is also useful for tech chasing, as Snake can predict his opponent's tech option and potentially rack up more damage or possibly even KO the opponent if the player makes the correct read. His up throw can combo into his up tilt at low percents as a solid damage racker, and his back throw can combo into his dash attack at low percents as well as C4 at mid to high percents. Lastly, his forward and back throws have decent knockback scaling, making them great for setting up edgeguards or, to a lesser degree, KOing at very high percents. Finally, Snake's special moves allow for many fantastic options. His neutral special, Hand Grenade, is arguably one of the best projectiles in the game for many reasons. It is infamous for starting on frame 1, which lets Snake instantly escape combos once he is out of hitstun and also makes it to where opponents must be cautious when trying to combo or juggle him in an effort to not get hit by his grenades. Grenades are also very useful for zoning and as defensive options, as Snake can shield while holding one to make pressuring his shield dangerous. They are also very useful for stage control, ledge trapping, setups, and as camping tools. His side special, Remote Missile, is one of the greatest edgeguarding tools in the game, thanks to its controllable movement, strong knockback, and low commitment, as Snake can edgeguard opponents with ease without leaving the stage. His down special, C4, is a remote activated bomb with strong power. It can also be difficult to see at times due to its small size and is among the best and most versatile trapping and stage-controlling tools in the game thanks to how it essentially puts certain parts of the stage ""off-limits"" and forces opponents to move in a different part of the stage where Snake can continually pressure them. Additionally, Snake can attach it to the opponent if he is close enough, which gives him an opportunity to deal high damage or potentially KO at high percents, especially if used as confirm out of his back throw. It can also be used to extend his recovery by placing one down in midair and detonating it immediately. Lastly, his up special, Cypher, is his main recovery move and goes a considerable distance and doesn't leave him helpless. It also provides Snake with some damaged based armor, and a useful lingering hitbox that can cover his air dodge to the ledge.","In spite of his strengths, Snake still has noticeable weaknesses, one of which being his frame data. While he does have several moves with remarkably quick start-up (jab, down aerial, back aerial, Hand Grenade, down smash, and all of his tilts), the majority of his moveset has very high endlag, making them easy to punish if missed. While his aforementioned forward aerial and forward smash are quite strong, they have the highest startup lag of their types in the game. His reliance on explosive projectiles in the neutral can be a downside in matchups against characters with energy-absorbing moves, such as Ness, Lucas, or Mr. Game & Watch, or against characters that can use his explosives against him such as Villager or Isabelle. His recovery can also be very vulnerable at times. Though the Cypher does have positive attributes, it can be rather slow and easy to catch. Many moves can hit right though the armor, and if it gets destroyed without Snake taking damage, he will become helpless. This situation can easily lead to a lost stock when recovering low. There is also a period of time after the Cypher is deployed in which it can not be acted out of. These issues lead to Snake favoring a very high recovery in most situations. Unfortunately, getting back to stage from so far up offers the opponent a large window of time to chase down his landing. To evade a good opponent, the Snake player must consistently mix-up his landing with different movement options and attacks. Mastery of Snake's explosives, falling aerials, air dodges and reverse specials is required for a safe and consistent return to the stage. Snake also has a notoriously poor disadvantage state. As a heavy character he is still vulnerable to combo strings and juggling. Grenade somewhat mitigates this issue as it can be used as a frame one combo breaking tool. However, this tactic does have downsides. If the grenade activates, Snake will receive damage and knockback. At higher percents, he may end up at a greater disadvantage or possibly lose a stock. Some characters can also hit Snake without ever triggering the grenade. Carelessly thrown grenades can also be used by opponents, who will often have better follow-ups at their disposal than Snake. Despite the various uses of his C4, it automatically detonates after a certain period of time, which can damage Snake or even KO him if the player carelessly activates it or loses track of its detonation time frame. Finally, some of Snake's aerial moves can be punished due to their noticeable landing lag if they fail to hit an opponent. Snake can also struggle to kill. His two most reliable killing options (up tilt and down throw) can be rather predictable at times. This is especially true for down throw. High level players know that reaching 159% means a 100% guaranteed death to Snake's next grab. Though Nikita missiles are strong for edgeguarding, many characters have a variety of options to deal with Nikita. This issue can be partially mitigated by shield canceling it after the missile gets hit to activate a secondary hitbox. However, this tactic significantly reduces the damage and knockback of the Missile. ","Overall, Snake is a zoning and stage-trapping oriented character with versatile specials and projectiles for forcing the opponent to move into a disadvantageous position. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he is required to stay at a distance to be most effective. He possesses several fast and strong melee attacks, which can easily rack up damage, and keep the opponent off of him. Throughout the first year of Ultimate, Snake achieved impressive results from players such as Ally and MVD. However, after Ally was banned from events, Snake's results have gotten slightly worse, but he nonetheless has top level representatives such as Hurt, ApolloKage, MVD and DIO."
Aegis,1,9.631,"Pyra and Mythra are ranked 5th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing the Aegis in the S tier. Pyra offers higher KO power and longer range of the two, making her more suited for taking opponents' stocks. She also possesses a strong meteor smash in the form of her down aerial to gimp opponents, which has a very large disjointed hitbox, and can combo into kill moves such as up aerial and up smash when opponents are on the ground. She does have poor mobility and low combo potential, but she can swap to Mythra to cover those weaknesses. Mythra and Pyra are ranked 5th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing the Aegis in the S tier. Mythra offers faster frame data and a larger combo game of the two, making her more suited for racking up damage. She also possesses the fighter ability, Foresight, which allows her gain the frame advantage when dodging as her opponent attacks her at the cost of taking a little damage, akin to Bayonetta's Bat Within. However, she does have some weaknesses. She has very low KO power, but she can swap to Pyra to cover that weakness. Sheâ€™s also a middleweight fast-faller, which not only makes her susceptible to combos but also early kill setups. Finally, her recovery is linear and very predictable as neither Photon Edge nor Chroma Dust travel very far and she cannot use both in the air, which makes her offstage game risky and unsafe.","Pyra is the stronger component of the Aegis, possessing vastly superior KO potential, damage output and overall range. Like Mythra, Pyra is a middleweight, albeit on the heavier side of the weight class (weighing the same as Mario, Dr. Mario, and Corrin). Despite her weight class, Pyra is burdened with very slow mobility: aside from her above-average air speed, she has the 6th slowest dashing speed, below-average walking speed, and slightly below-average air acceleration. However, compared to other fighters in and around her weight class, her overall character type is similar to that of traditional heavyweights thanks to her plethora of hard-hitting attacks. Mythra is the faster component of the Aegis, possessing vastly superior mobility and overall frame data to her counterpart (mainly in regards to overall duration in terms of ending lag), but weaker attacks and overall shorter range. Like Pyra, she is a middleweight, albeit on the lighter end of the weight class, due to weighing the same as the Ice Climbers, Lucario, Wolf, Villager and Steve. Mythra boasts the 11th fastest air speed, 8th fastest walking speed, 7th fastest falling speed, 7th highest gravity value, 5th fastest dashing speed, and the fastest initial dash in the game, as well as decent traction. However, Mythra's jump height is below-average, while her short hop, double jump and air acceleration values are merely average. Overall, these traits make her a character similar to the likes of Captain Falcon, Sheik, Chrom or Little Mac; she is a very fast and generally offense-oriented character who excels at whiff punishing, tech-chasing, comboing, juggling and maintaining stage control in the neutral game, and has access to useful burst options as well.  ","While Pyra's power is perhaps her most dominant strength, her range is also very formidable. As a swordswoman who fights with her respective Aegis Sword, almost all of Pyra's standard attacks (barring the first hit of neutral attack) are disjointed, aiding her in directly challenging incoming attacks. This also means that with proper spacing, her aerial moves are hard to punish on shield at maximum distance, allowing her to easily break shields with simple air-to-ground combos. However, Pyra's range also means that with her forward smash, which is one of the longest-reaching in the game, she can bypass counterattacks more effectively than most other characters at maximum distance. The majority of Pyra's offensive utility comes from her grounded moveset. Her neutral attack comes out on frame 3, making it her fastest attack overall as well as a decent close-range pressure option. Despite dealing less damage than other heavyweight non-infinite jabs, her jab combo is very strong overall, being able to KO starting at 195% from the center of Final Destination. Her forward tilt has very good coverage in front of her and has strong KO potential, while her up tilt hits all around her and KOs very early at 130% from ground level, while also having surprisingly low end lag for its power. While her down tilt is her weakest tilt attack, its speed enables it to work as a poking option and combo tool, while it also hits low enough to hit certain characters hanging on edges. Her smash attacks are her primary finishers, while they all share a balance of range and power; her forward smash is surprisingly fast for its power and range at only 20 frames of startup, while it can KO as early as 75% from center stage uncharged. Her up smash is similar to Lucas's equivalent move in that it has a very good range overall along with equally strong KO power. Her down smash is her weakest smash attack, although also her fastest, and unlike other ""sweeping"" down smashes, provides excellent coverage in front and behind due to hitting both sides at once for both hits. Pyra's aerial game also provides other offensive options. Her neutral aerial, despite its slow startup, hits all around her much like Ike's equivalent move, and can KO starting at 155% from ground level. Her forward aerial is very fast despite her generally slow frame data and has roughly the same KO power as her neutral aerial. Her back aerial covers a very wide arc behind her and KOs extremely early at 115% from ground level despite its vertical knockback, allowing it to be used as a niche (albeit slow) option if used in a reverse aerial rush. Her up aerial hits in a very wide arc above her and autocancels in a full hop, while her down aerial is a meteor smash that can KO and start combos, being able to lead into KO confirms depending on the opponent's weight and falling speed. Lastly, Pyra has an overall versatile set of special moves apart from her down special. Flame Nova, her neutral special, acts a spinning move much like the Links' Spin Attacks, in that it hits in front in behind and can be charged for more damage. Blazing End, her side special, is a projectile that functions like the Links' respective Boomerangs, dealing damage while moving forward (although it cannot move vertically). Prominence Revolt, her up special, is similar to Stone Scabbard, being a rise-then-fall attack that acts as her recovery option, while it works exceptionally well as an out of shield option due to its range and power, and can sweetspot edges on the way up. Lastly, her down special, Swap, switches her with Mythra while granting some invincibility during the switch, allowing to switch playstyles on the fly. One of Mythra's greatest strengths is the speed and utility of her grounded moveset. Neutral attack is Mythra's fastest move, coming out on frame 2; this makes it useful for intercepting opposing attacks or sometimes even approaching, the latter thanks to her incredibly fast ground speed. As a swordswoman who fights with her respective Aegis Sword, almost all of Mythra's standard attacks (barring the first hit of neutral attack) are also disjointed as well, aiding her in directly challenging incoming attacks. Mythra's three tilt attacks are very quick moves, with each possessing the ability to start or extend combos. Down tilt has fast startup and very low ending lag, as well as fairly low knockback even at very high percents, allowing it to combo into most of her standard moveset; up tilt can combo into itself and/or most of her aerials; and even forward tilt can combo at low to mid percents. The speed of Mythra's tilts can make them difficult to react to, and good spacing can sometimes potentially also make them difficult to punish as well. Her dash attack is fast by swordfighter standards, coming out on frame 9, and it also provides her with solid forward momentum that makes it fairly useful as a burst option. Finally, her smash attacks are decently fast KOing options with solid ranges: forward smash comes out on frame 14 and is her strongest smash attack with the most range, but has the slowest startup of her smashes; up smash comes out on frame 9 and has a lingering hitbox, making it a decent out of shield option from the front; and down smash is her fastest smash attack, coming out on frame 8, and hits twice simultaneously on both sides. However, Mythra's smash attacks are fairly weak; they only KO at moderately high percents, even when fully charged. Mythra's aerial attacks are quite effective. Her up, back and down aerials can all autocancel in a short hop, and except for down aerial, all of her aerials come out on frame 10 or sooner. Neutral aerial hits three times and provides good coverage all around her; similarly to Byleth's, it also possesses a landing hitbox, which can be used to start combos. Her forward and back aerials are good combo finishers (with back aerial more importantly also being useful for starting or extending combos), covering a decent area in front and/or behind her. Up aerial is a good juggle move, and has an extremely generous autocancel window, even more so than all her other aerials. Finally, down aerial completely lacks the meteor smashing capability of Pyra's equivalent move, but it is Mythra's most damaging aerial attack if hit with the clean hit of the move, and possesses the most KO power of her aerials as well. Mythra additionally possesses fairly versatile special moves. Lightning Buster is a chargeable move that comes out on frame 9 when uncharged; charging it increases the move's power, and the move even possesses a hitbox on Mythra's sword while charging (nicknamed the ""bustersaw"" hitbox); it can KO most opponents near the edge at around 100% with a mild charge, and it can even be used off-stage as a mixup to cover airdodges. Lightning Buster can even be reversed after charging, similarly to Mii Swordfighter's Blurring Blade and Sephiroth's Shadow Flare, which can potentially be used for mindgames. Photon Edge is a useful burst option directly which can hit up to six times and has decent damage output as well; it can be difficult to challenge thanks to the move's hitboxes being placed on the multiple visible Mythra duplicates, none of which have a hurtbox, and it can also be used as a horizontal recovery option as well. Ray of Punishment starts on frame 10, making it a decent out of shield option when combined with the initial slash's hitbox, and the initial slash in particular combos into the resulting projectile fairly well thanks to its unusually high hitstun; holding the special button or pressing it more than once turns the move into Chroma Dust instead, with the singular downward projectile instead replaced with multiple smaller projectiles. Ray of Punishment in particular is also an excellent combo finisher as well. As a recovery move, Ray of Punishment/Chroma Dust is capable of sweetspotting ledges while rising, and if Mythra goes past a ledge, the projectile(s) can somewhat cover her ledge grab. Lastly, her down special, Swap, swaps her out with Pyra while granting some intangibility during the switch, allowing the player to switch playstyles on the fly. Mythra's grab game is not nearly as overwhelming as the rest of her moveset, but it is not without its uses. Her standing grab has average range, but it is slightly disjointed and is tied for the fastest in the game startup-wise. Her dash and pivot grabs also have similarly slightly disjointed grabboxes as well, with the former in particular additionally having decent forward momentum that can be enhanced with a boost grab. Her pummel has average speed but an above-average damage output, making it a decent one overall. Down throw is her most damaging throw, and it is also her main combo throw, leading into any aerial (except for down aerial) as well as Ray of Punishment at low to medium percentages. Forward throw can confirm into dash attack at low percentages against many characters, and can also set up tech-chases and edgeguards quite effectively. Back throw can combo into dash attack against certain fast-fallers, and it can be used for positioning or setting up edgeguards as well, but is less useful than down and forward throws. Finally, her up throw can combo into Ray of Punishment at very low percentages, but is otherwise not very useful; however, it is difficult to react to and can potentially set up juggles. In addition to her moveset, Mythra also possesses a special mechanic called Foresight, which functions similarly to Bayonetta's Bat Within. If Mythra dodges a few frames before she would have been hit by a move, Mythra takes roughly 50% of that move's damage and no knockback, while the opponent suffers additional lag and is put in a slowdown state similarly to Witch Time, allowing Mythra a free combo, neutral win or even a KO. This helps her disadvantage state, as Foresight allows her to escape slightly untrue combos or juggles.","However, Pyra has glaring flaws that are enough to balance out her range and power. As mentioned earlier, her overall mobility is very slow to compensate for her large, powerful attacks. Despite her long range, said speed ironically renders her approach limited even against characters with less range, such as Pit and Sonic, and even other weapon wielders like Joker (especially with his own dashing speed). This also translates thoroughly into her moveset, as while her moves are more frame-flexible than other similar characters such as Ganondorf, they are still punishable due to their high end lag, meaning that a single mistake can easily allow opponents to get close to her. Her special moves also carry certain flaws as well. Flame Nova has some considerable startup (unless uncharged), while the move does not protect her from above, meaning that characters with good aerial mobility and frame data (such as Falco) can easily approach her with little risk, making the move unsafe if used repeatedly. Blazing End puts Pyra in a state where she is unable to use any other moves until the Aegis Sword returns to her hand, during which she will briefly enter a 20-frame state where she will stop in place. This is especially exploitable with characters that have powerful throws or moves that send her far offstage where the sword may not return to Pyra in time to transform into Mythra for recovery. Lastly, Prominence Revolt has very little horizontal distance potential (only traveling a set horizontal distance of half the length of Battlefield's platform); this when combined with the move's mainly vertical recovery angle makes the move likely to self-destruct if Pyra is too far from the ledge. It also cannot sweetspot ledges from behind leading to a self-destruct if she doesn't reverse the move when facing away from the ledge. Because of this, her sole way of recovery is to use her aerial mobility to make it to just above or below the edge before using Prominence Revolt. Moreover, Prominence Revolt's descent also has a significantly weaker meteor smash than similar moves such as Aether, making the move easier to challenge directly and ill-suited for attempting sacrificial KOs. Pyra also has a poor disadvantage state, as her average weight, frame size and below-average frame data make her susceptible to combos, while she lacks safe options for interrupting enemy combos. This means that she is also very vulnerable to high-damage combos that end with semi-spikes, as the damage accumulated may be enough for the finishing blow to keep her sufficiently away from the ledge. This is further exacerbated with Prominence Revolt's aforementioned low horizontal distance. Although Swap enables Mythra to remedy the latter flaw somewhat, it is not a failsafe strategy: unlike PokÃ©mon Change, Swap does not grant intangibility until frame 6, making it inefficient as a combo breaker, while Mythra's recovery options are also somewhat mediocre all around despite her vastly superior aerial mobility. Lastly, Pyra has an overall weak grab game. While her pummel is tied with other characters as the third-most damaging in Ultimate, her throws are overall weak with limited utility (especially her back throw), with only her forward throw dealing more than 8%. Her forward throw can KO at very high percentages at the edge, her up throw can position opponents for KO setups with poor DI/react time, and her down throw can force the opponent into unfavorable aerial positions, where she can follow up if the opponent does not properly react while being able to KO after 200%. However, since said throws are not as powerful as traditional KO throws, they are instead best used to position or edgeguard opponents. Despite her immense agility, Mythra is balanced by a severe lack of KO options (although swapping to Pyra remedies this completely). Outside of her smash attacks and charged Lightning Buster, none of her moveset reliably KOs at the ledge at 150%; however, Mythra still has the ability to combo several of her weaker attacks into those moves (such as comboing down tilt into Lightning Buster via the ""bustersaw"" charging hitbox) for potential KO confirms, which may alleviate this weakness. Additionally, Mythra's raw damage output is also very poor, a weakness shared with Sheik and default Joker. This also ties into yet another weakness that Mythra has; outside of her aerials, forward and down tilts, and sufficiently charged Lightning Buster, none of Mythra's moves are safer than -11 on shield, which can make her vulnerable to shield grabs and aggressive out of shield options if her attacks are not properly spaced. Also, her range is only average for a swordfighter, and she lacks a projectile outside of her up special, meaning she can sometimes struggle against certain zoners, although her excellent mobility compensates for that. Mythra's grab game is also not without its flaws, either; starting at higher percents, her throw combos stop being true, limiting the utility of her forward and down throws (especially the latter). None of her throws reliably KO either, even at Sudden Death percentages. Her only utility from her throws at these percentages is positional throws. Her aerials also have weaknesses as well. Despite being decently fast for a swordfighter overall, her aerial frame data is only average for a fighter, with her quickest aerials, neutral and forward aerial, coming out on frame 8, making them unsuitable for breaking out of combos. Compared to most other fighters who share a similar archetype, none of her aerials possess decent KO power, with similar fighters having at least one with notable KO potential. Examples include Sonic's back aerial, Greninja's forward aerial, Fox's back aerial, Zero Suit Samus's back aerial, Captain Falcon's back aerial and Knee Smash, Chrom's back aerial, and Sheik's up aerial. Her back aerial, coming out on frame 10, has below-average startup for a combo tool. Her down aerial is inarguably her least useful aerial. Due to coming out on frame 13, down aerial is among the slowest non-stall-then-fall down aerials in the game to lack a meteor smash, and it launches opponents too far to have any meaningful utility after landing, all while still having very poor KO potential. Her special moves, while decent, have weaknesses to balance them out. While Lightning Buster is a potential KO option, it only covers one side of Mythra (except for the very first hit, which hits both behind and in front of her), leaving her open if misused. Photon Edge is very unsafe on shield and renders Mythra helpless if used in the air. It also does not sweetspot the ledge until after the move ends. Additionally, Photon Edge has transcendent priority, meaning that it is easily intercepted by most projectiles; and while the hitboxes have impressive horizontal disjoint, they are not very vertically disjointed from Mythra's main hurtbox, which is static and does not match up with the Mythra duplicates visible during the move, meaning that if she recovers using the move, she is highly vulnerable to meteor smashes from directly above (especially if she recovers low with the move). Ray of Punishment also covers decent vertical distance but little horizontal distance by itself, although Mythra does have decent horizontal drift afterward. Foresight is also a double-edged sword for Mythra. While it allows Mythra to punish blockable attacks, it also gives Mythra the slowest dodges in the game, with intangibility for her forward roll, spot dodge, and back roll starting on frame 7 for the former two dodges and 8 for the latter; this makes her vulnerable to grabs and other unblockable attacks. Mythra's directional air dodge distance is counterbalanced by the Foresight mechanic itself. If Foresight is activated during her air dodges, she will travel downward instead of remaining in place, which may lead to self-destructs. Additionally, if it is activated during her directional air dodge, she will travel a shorter distance than usual and will still suffer the entire ending lag of the dodge. Unlike with regular directional air dodges, Mythra in this particular state is not even able to grab ledges, due to the ending lag being considered part of the Foresight animation, along with said animation being impossible to interrupt in any way until it is completed. Perhaps Mythra's single biggest weakness, however, is her very exploitable recovery. Although she has very good air speed and her directional air dodge covers more distance than most others in the game (barring those of Ness and Lucas), she is burdened by a poor double jump, an incredibly fast falling speed, and as mentioned before, Ray of Punishment is an almost strictly vertical jump, while Photon Edge leaves Mythra helpless and does not snap to ledges until the very end. In addition, neither move offers Mythra any protection from above (except for the initial slash of the former move), leaving her very susceptible to footstools. Additionally, her directional air dodge is risky to use for recovery due to the Foresight mechanic as mentioned above. If Mythra uses Ray of Punishment on an off-stage opponent while she is recovering, they can wall jump tech after getting hit by the projectile and punish her, similarly to the Tech Check technique. Mythra is also susceptible to semi-spikes, as getting hit by a sufficiently strong one means that she will likely be unable to recover. It is also very common for even the weakest of projectiles, such as Mario's Fireball or Banjo & Kazooie's Egg Firing, to be enough to gimp Mythra and prevent her from recovering to the stage. Disadvantage can also be difficult for Mythra, though doable with Foresight. Her fast falling speed and high gravity render her susceptible to certain combos (such as Steve's jab/forward tilt combos), and her merely average air acceleration can make it difficult for her to adjust her aerial drift while being juggled compared to other speedy characters with superior air acceleration, such as Fox, Sheik, and Zero Suit Samus. And unlike PokÃ©mon Change, Swap does not grant intangibility until frame 6, making it inefficient as a combo breaker. This is further compounded by Pyra's disadvantage state being even worse than Mythra's. ","Overall, Pyra is a hard-hitting, yet surprisingly versatile swordswoman who excels at punishing. She must be patient to look for openings due to her slow mobility and poor disadvantage state. In addition, Pyra is best utilized when she and Mythra have the advantage so as to alleviate their respective weaknesses and amplify their respective strengths, whereas it is considered best to switch to her counterpart to keep advantage due to Mythra's sheer flexibility and vastly superior movement. Not too long after the Aegis' release, professional players such as MkLeo, Sparg0 and Shuton have demonstrated very strong results with Pyra, particularly when used in tandem with Mythra, and her representation and results have further expanded since then. Most players believe the Aegis is top tier or even among the best characters in the game, alongside the commonly accepted Steve and Joker. Overall, Mythra is an incredibly quick swordswoman who excels at zone-breaking, pressuring, tech-chasing, and stage control. She also has respectable combo potential, and is decent at juggling and, like Pyra, punishing (albeit not to the same impact as her counterpart). In addition, Mythra is best utilized when she and Pyra have the advantage so as to alleviate their respective weaknesses and amplify their respective strengths, and when horizontal recovery distance is required, whereas it is considered best to switch to her counterpart to keep advantage due to Pyra's vastly stronger attacks and more impactful punishes. Despite her glaring and exploitable weaknesses, Mythra's strengths compensate for them, and players like Cosmos and Shuton have demonstrated in offline competitive play that she is indeed a competitively viable character, especially when used in tandem with Pyra via Swap. Most players believe that the Aegis is high- or top-tier, with many of them even considering her to be among the best characters in the game, alongside the commonly accepted Steve and Joker."
R.O.B.,1,9.62,"R.O.B. is ranked 6th out of 82 on the tier list, placing him at the end of the S tier. This is a significant improvement from his placement in SSB4, where he was ranked 35th out of 54, and is his best placement in the series to date. R.O.B.'s biggest strengths come from his ultimately improved moveset, allowing him to play both an offensive and defensive playstyle. His entire moveset has received increased utility overall, allowing him to box out his opponents with ease, as well as KOing more effectively and edgeguard opponents with limited recovery without the risk of himself self-destructing. His attributes of lingering hitboxes and heavy weight allow him to survive to incredibly high percents, making him among the best zoners in the game due to being able to patiently chip away at the opponent's percentage until finding an opportunity to rushdown and close out a stock. He also possesses arguably one of the best item-generating moves in the form of Gyro, which has several practical applications of usage including KO combos into Arm Rotor, which has been retooled into a potent finishing move at the ledge or offstage. While sporting a myriad of strengths, R.O.B. is not without weaknesses. His most well-known one is his large hurtboxes, which makes him an easy target both on stage and off stage. When combined with his heavy weight and above-average falling speed, he is extremely susceptible to combos, which is only exacerbated by the slow startup of his aerials (excluding his forward and up aerials) giving him little in the way of combo breakers. Despite being heavily reliant on grabs to initiate combos, his grab is among the shortest-ranged in the game and can be easily punished if a grab misses. His moveset revolving around several projectiles means he is under a disadvantage against opponents with a reflector, and his large hurtboxes and recovery being a finite resource while airborne means he can easily be edgeguarded himself by being highly susceptible to 2 frame punishes and being walled out from until being forced to SD. Despite these weaknesses, R.O.B. has seen large representation from multiple players such as Zackray, Zomba, Anathema, and MKBigBoss. As a result, he is among one of the most common characters seen in majors and tournaments, consistently ranking in the top 3 for representation in the metagame.","R.O.B. is the eighteenth-heaviest character in the game, being tied with Snake and Banjo & Kazooie, thus rendering him a heavyweight. R.O.B. sports an above-average walking speed, initial dash, and falling speed, is tied with Ike and Bowser Jr. for the 26th-fastest air speed, average dashing speed, gravity, and traction, as well as the 30th-highest air acceleration. This grants him mobility that is fairly average overall, yet balanced compared to most of his fellow heavyweights. This, along with several of his other attributes, most notably his extremely long-distanced recovery, noticeably set him apart from most of them.","Like in Brawl and Smash 4, R.O.B. is a zoning-oriented character with versatile projectiles to keep his opponents at bay. Robo Beam enables him to attack from considerable distance, and becomes the noticeably stronger Super Robo Beam when it is left idle for 14.3 seconds. While Robo Beam interrupts opponents faster, Super Robo Beam deals more damage and has higher knockback growth. Gyro is an auto-chargeable projectile that becomes an item when fired. Compared to Robo Beam, it has a more favorable angle for disrupting opponents, while also being more manipulable as a projectile and possessing greater KO power. Thanks to R.O.B.'s item throws being among the strongest in the game, Gyro is also especially useful when smash thrown as an item. Aside from his projectiles, R.O.B.'s grounded game is also excellent. His neutral attack comes out on frame 3 and acts as a quick move at low percentages to escape pressuring situations, and it can also jab lock and combo. Forward tilt can be useful for spacing at higher percentages since it comes out on frame 7, but its usefulness ends there. Up tilt comes out on frame 4, and is great for acting as an anti-air and combos into his up aerial. Down tilt is R.O.B.'s single-best move in his entire kit, as it lowers his hurtbox, has great range, is tied with his jab as his fastest move at frame 3, pressures shields, trades with shield grabs, and its total active frames is only 14, meaning it is one of the safest pressuring moves in the game. It also combos into itself at lower percentages, and at higher percents, it can combo into grab or dash attack, and can send opponents into a jab lock-based scenario for a KO at relatively low percentages. Lastly, dash attack is useful for punishing landings and whiffs, is extremely fast at frame 7, has relatively long range, and can combo into his forward air at low to medium percentages. R.O.B.'s air game is also great, thanks to the excellent and disjointed ranges of all excluding one of his aerials. Neutral aerial has large, disjointed hitboxes that make it great for covering the opponents' options if lacking the range to deal with it. It is also very hard to punish out of shield due to its damage, total landing lag (7 frames) and range. It is also a reliable combo starter at low to medium percentages when SHFF'd, as well as a useful spacing option and, to a lesser extent, a KOing tool. Up aerial is a great vertical KO move due to its large and long-lasting hitboxes, fast startup, and the last hitâ€™s high knockback. Back and down aerials are R.O.B.'s most damaging aerials when sweetspotted, and they too have large and disjointed hitboxes, much like neutral aerial. However, they also boast their own specific strengths: back aerial has recovery potential thanks to it propelling R.O.B. forward, and it is his only aerial that can KO in neutral due to its incredible knockback and huge hitbox. Not only that, but it is also one of the strongest back aerials in the game. Meanwhile, his down aerial is a powerful meteor smash that can hit below the ledge and KO very early if done so. It is also active for 6 whole frames, making it difficult to avoid for characters with linear recoveries. Lastly, forward aerial is R.O.B.'s fastest aerial coming out on frame 6, making it very spammable in neutral due to how low committal it is to use, as it is safe on shield. However, its hitbox has much shorter range and is not disjointed. R.O.B.'s grab game is also quite outstanding. Forward and back throws are decent for spacing and setting up edge-guards. The latter can also KO at the ledge at very high percents, and both can combo into dash attack or Gyro at minimal percents. In comparison, R.O.B.'s up throw is comparatively more useful: it is his most damaging throw, a solid KO move (especially when boosted by rage or if he lands on a platform), and can even be used for combos at low percentages. His down throw, despite not being a KOing move, is also one of his best tools for sealing a stock. While it deals poor damage, it buries opponents, allowing for follow-ups into up tilt, up air, or even up smash. However, with excessive button mashing, the opponent can typically get out before R.O.B. has any chance to act. As such, it is more of a read-based tool rather than a guaranteed method for taking a stock.","Although R.O.B. possesses a large number of strengths, he does also have a few noteworthy shortcomings. Despite possessing a good chunk of respectable KOing options, landing a KO can often be problematic because of his finishers being burdened with either considerable lag and/or unimpressive range. The latter trait is especially noticeable in regard to R.O.B.'s arm-based attacks, most of which have short ranges, which further extends to R.O.B.'s grab, which is among the shortest-ranged in Ultimate in comparison to his own size. In addition to R.O.B.'s issues with his hitboxes, his hurtbox also hinders him, as it is both large and wide, meaning he can get hit by a lot of combos that other characters would have an easier time evading. This also means that he has difficulty dealing with combo-oriented characters. This is further compounded by his above-average falling speed, as well as his aerials' inability to reliably break combos: neutral and down aerials are sluggish in terms of startup, forward and up aerials only hit in front of and above R.O.B., respectively, and back aerial is a mixture of both: it has slow startup and only hits behind him. ","Overall, R.O.B. is a non-traditional heavyweight zoner. His relatively quick mobility and overall above-average frame data allow him to easily pressure unwary opponents, and he lacks much trouble killing if he can gain the advantage. While his overall range is rather small for a zoner like him, it is functional in the long run regardless. However, R.O.B. players must take high caution, as a single combo can be all it requires to get R.O.B. in an uncomfortable position or potentially even end a stock, thanks to his large size, moderately high weight, above-average falling speed, and lack of options to break free from combos."
Peach,2,9.04,"Peach, alongside her Echo Fighter Daisy, is ranked 7th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her at the top of the S- tier. This is a notable improvement from her 20th out of 54 placement in SSB4, and is her best placement in the series. Peach is one of the most unique characters in the game with her ability to float and do some of the most damaging combos in the game through float canceling as well as an amazing movement option and recovery tool. Her Vegetable is also an outstanding and versatile item projectile that aids with her combo game as well as a solid edgeguarding tool. Her edgeguarding is also amazing thanks to her aforementioned float, allowing her to go far and deep with moves such as forward aerial, back aerial, neutral aerial, and more. While Ultimate introduced a multiplier that reduces damage if performing aerials in a short hop, she can completely ignore it by performing a full hop and float next to the ground, and since all her aerials can autocancel in a short hop, she can avoid the landing lag more easily than other characters. Floating also allow her to safely pressure her opponent's shields. All in all, this gives Peach some of the best and most dominant aerial games in Ultimate. However, Peach has several flaws. Her heavy reliance on aerials in the neutral game and somewhat ineffective smash attacks mean that she can sometimes have difficulty with KO-ing opponents as her moves stale, further worsened by the fact that her weight and falling speed can make her susceptible to getting KOâ€™d herself at fairly early percents. She is also lacking in range allowing for characters like Shulk and Cloud to wall her out effectively or hit her float. Peach also has some difficulty landing or getting back to the ground making her prone to juggling and her air dodge being one of the worst in terms of endlag. Finally, Peach is one of the most difficult characters to play because of her unique strengths and her float canceling techniques being a bit much for human error to take into account due to her precision. Overall, Peach is a strong character that can do a lot of damage but she requires a lot of dedication and commitment to take her to the highest level. Despite this, she has consistently been seen as among the best characters in the game throughout the gameâ€™s lifespan, with most notably Samsora in the early metagame showing strong results at supermajors before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the post pandemic era, players such as MuteAce have continued to bring strong results for her.","Peach is a somewhat light character who is quite slow in terms of walking speed and dashing speed, and has an extremely slow falling speed and very low gravity, while her air speed is only average. While this is an unfavorable combination of traits, it is compensated by her unique floating ability and her very high air acceleration.","Peach's aerial game is one of her greatest strengths. Her floating ability grants her the power to hover at any height she chooses, giving her a distinct advantage in aerial combat. Floating also helps her to control space; floating low to the ground and using retreating aerials makes her difficult to punish, and this greatly helps her own approach as well. With good spacing, she can attack the opponent's shield with little fear of reprisal. Float can increase her mobility and movement options, allowing her to frustrate her opponents with quick and unpredictable mixups. Additionally, floating aids Peach's off-stage presence when combined with her slow falling speed, despite her low jumps and the high ending lag of her aerial attacks (except for down aerial); not only does it help her cover certain angles when edgeguarding, it can also be used to aid her horizontal recovery or potentially even allow her to go underneath stages to stall. Neutral aerial is her fastest aerial with the lowest landing lag, and deals an impressively high amount of damage despite its speed while also possessing a decently long duration; when combined with her ability to float close to the ground, neutral aerial's combination of fast startup, low base knockback and low landing lag makes it an incredibly good combo tool at lower percents that can even lead into itself with enough technical skill, especially after a down tilt, while its damage output and knockback scaling ensures that it still has decent KO potential at higher ones. Her forward aerial is her slowest aerial attack, but it is also her strongest one, and it can be used while floating to search for a finishing move with relative safety, especially given its disjointed hitbox and fairly low landing lag relative to its strength; however, it possesses a weaker sourspot on her arm. Her back aerial possesses a decent combination of fast startup with good range and power in addition to being her most reliable follow-up from a down throw, and although it suffers from notable ending lag compared to other back aerials, Peach's float and slow falling speed compensate for this. Up aerial hits twice and is impressively disjointed, while the first hit can potentially drag down opponents after a short hop height down aerial for grounded follow-ups; however, its horizontal range compared to Peach's other aerial attacks is somewhat lacking. Finally, her down aerial has the lowest ending lag of all her aerial attacks, and can be used as a potential combo starter at low to middle percents thanks to the final hit's vertical angle. Comparatively, her grounded attacks are less effective in direct comparison, but are not without utility. Neutral attack comes out on frame 2, making it not only Peach's fastest attack, but also one of the fastest neutral attacks in the entire game; conversely, it is fairly weak compared to other two-hit jabs. Up tilt has a disjointed hitbox above her and can be used as an anti-air attack. Forward tilt is a potential follow-up from down throw, has decent horizontal and vertical range while being disjointed, and uniquely has a vertical launch angle. Down tilt is her fastest tilt attack, and while it is less disjointed than her other tilts, it possesses decent combo potential; with sufficient technical skill, it is possible to follow up the move with multiple neutral aerials performed from ground-level floats. Dash attack is relatively fast and decently disjointed, with the first hit reliably leading into the second, and it can also serve as a potential KO move at very high percents. She has a decent grab game, as her down throw can be followed up with a back aerial, forward tilt or neutral aerial, forward and back throws can easily setup edgeguards, and back throw can even serve as a KO move at extremely high percents. Peach also has a potent if somewhat situational set of smash attacks, all of them possessing reasonably good range: her forward smash can be angled up or down, giving her access to three different weapons (golf club if unangled, frying pan if angled up, or tennis racket if angled down), each with their own useful properties; down smash is a multi-hit attack good for catching rolls and edge recovery options; and her up smash is a particularly powerful move when sweetspotted, while also granting intangibility to her head and arms. Her special moves have their uses as well. Toad is a counterattack where if either Peach or Toad himself are attacked, the latter will retaliate with spores hitting multiple times. Like most other counterattacks, the move can be used as an edgeguarding tool against certain recovery moves with damaging hitboxes, most notably Ike's Aether and Chrom's Soaring Slash. Unlike most other counterattacks, Toad does not scale relative to the strength of the attack countered. Toad's spores can be reflected or absorbed, with the former property rendering the move useless against many reflectors, such as Mario's Cape or Fox's Reflector. Peach Bomber is a move where Peach lunges forward and strikes with her rear; it can be used as a horizontal recovery option in addition to her aforementioned floating ability, its travel distance is increased if the move is smash-inputted, and in addition to being decently strong if successfully landed, it is also very difficult to punish out of shield because of how she rebounds after successfully hitting a target, though it suffers from high ending lag if whiffed. Peach Parasol is a serviceable vertical recovery move, and can be used as an out-of-shield option thanks to its fast startup and decent range. It is also fairly difficult to contest from above thanks to its large disjoint above her and lingering hitbox if the parasol is kept open after ascending. Finally, Vegetable serves as her projectile, and as a throwable item, it is quite a versatile one; the move also has a 1/250 chance of spawning a powerful Bob-omb and a 1/166 chance of spawning a shield-shattering Mr. Saturn.","While Peach has exceptional strengths, that does not mean she has no weaknesses. Faster opponents may be able to overwhelm her before she can begin throwing vegetables or otherwise defend herself. If thrown into the air, she can have difficulty landing, and when combined with her floatiness, this makes her susceptible to juggling and vertical combos. Peach's ability to approach suffers against swordfighters like Shulk and Cloud or zoners like R.O.B. and Samus, as she lacks the agility to get in close before they can hit her. Her recovery, while very good, is also a potential point of failure, as while she can travel a great deal of horizontal distance, she can also be left vulnerable if forced to rely on Peach Parasol and her vertical recovery is average at best (discounting the incredibly dangerous and situational Bob-omb), as well as predictable. Additionally, her vegetables, being item projectiles, can be picked up by opponents and used against her, despite being fairly useful overall.\","Overall, Peach is a technical character that, once mastered, is a major threat to any opponent. Her floating ability, very high air acceleration, and solid aerial attacks give Peach a fantastic air game that allows her to easily outmaneuver her opponents, and initiate devastating set-ups, which is further supplemented with useful specials. However, Peach players have to be aware of her slow grounded movement, somewhat light weight, and extreme floatiness by maximizing her floating ability to constantly transition between the ground and the air, and carefully utilize her moveset to avoid being punished for even a simple mistake."
Fox,2,9.019,"Fox is ranked 8th out of 82 on the tier list placing him in S- tier. This is a slight improvement from his placement in Smash 4 where he was ranked 7th/8th out of 54 and tied with Sonic. Fox's biggest strengths revolve around his phenomenal movement options, stellar frame data, and high damage output, which gives him the ability to overwhelm opponents easily and allows him to have one of the best neutrals and advantage states in the entire game. Fox also has several ways to kill reliably thanks to his powerful and quick smash attacks and his notoriously safe back aerial at ledge. Finally, Fox's combo and juggling game also greatly benefits from universal changes made in the transition from Smash 4 to Ultimate, such as the game's increased speed, reduction to landing lag, and airdodging nerfs. However, Fox also has some noticeable weaknesses. His most notable weakness is his survivability, as Fox is one of the lightest characters in the game and has the fastest falling speed and gravity out of anyone in the roster. This means his endurance is poor compared to the rest of the cast, as he is rather susceptible to combos and potential early KOs. Finally, although Fox has several recovery options that cover a great distance, their linearity makes it easy for Fox to be edgeguarded continuously if the player isn't careful. Overall, Fox's strengths outweigh his weaknesses, and he has garnered several strong results from players such as Light, Kaninabe and Paseriman.","Fox is a lightweight, hit-and-run type character with excellent grounded mobility and good frame data for the majority of his moveset. Fox is incredibly mobile: he possesses the sixth-fastest dashing speed, third-fastest walking speed, 33rd fastest air speed, 21st highest air acceleration, the highest falling (and thus fast falling) speed and gravity in the game, with the latter two allowing him to quickly move from the air to the ground with ease. These attributes allow him to keep up with almost any opponent while additionally making him very difficult to punish.","Fox is a lightweight, hit-and-run type character with excellent grounded mobility and good frame data for the majority of his moveset. Fox is incredibly mobile: he possesses the sixth-fastest dashing speed, third-fastest walking speed, 33rd fastest air speed, 21st highest air acceleration, the highest falling (and thus fast falling) speed and gravity in the game, with the latter two allowing him to quickly move from the air to the ground with ease. These attributes allow him to keep up with almost any opponent while additionally making him very difficult to punish. In terms of attack speed, almost all of Fox's moves have less than 10 frames of startup lag, which greatly helps him with approaching and comboing, while some of them are decently powerful despite their quick startup. All of his grounded moves excluding smash attacks have both low startup and ending lag, which allows them to connect and flow into each other extremely easily. All of his aerials also have quick startup lag, and some of them are able to auto-cancel from a short hop (back aerial, up aerial), or have low landing lag (neutral aerial, back aerial). Alongside his fast falling speed, this gives him a good aerial approach and shield pressure. Another one of Fox's biggest strengths is his combo potential. Almost all of his moves can combo into each other and he even has several KO confirms. Though a majority of his combos are not as lengthy compared to other characters like Sheik, the higher damage output makes up for it. Fox's tilts are an important part of his combo game. Forward tilt, while mostly used for spacing, can be used as a combo starter at low to mid percentages and can start tech chases at higher percentages, giving Fox an opportunity to extend his combos if the opponent fails to tech or if the tech is read properly. Up tilt can combo into itself and can lead to other grounded moves or aerials. Down tilt is one of Fox's best combo starters despite it being difficult to connect, and can combo into most of his aerials and up smash at various percentages. Dash attack is quick and is one of his best moves for whiff punishes, with its early hit being able to combo into several moves (most notably neutral aerial) or start a 50:50 scenario into his forward aerial or up aerial, while the late hit can set up into up smash as a KO confirm at high percentages. Fox's aerials are also a huge staple of his moveset, arguably being the most important part of his combo game. All of his aerials have either average or above-average damage output and they can combo into other aerials and some grounded moves, including smash attacks. Neutral aerial has very high speed, as well as low knockback, all of which allow it to combo into other moves even at high percentages, and allows it to serve as a reliable KO setup, with the weak hit of neutral aerial being able to lead into an up smash. Forward aerial can combo into up aerial and can drag opponents down if Fox lands before ending the move, allowing for jab lock/tech chase opportunities and can even drag the opponents down offstage, which can gimp certain characters. Back aerial can combo into grounded moves at lower percentages and is useful for shield pressure and KOing at high percentages. Up aerial deals the highest amount of damage and can combo into itself, making it a great juggling move. Additionally, it can serve as an effective KO move, which makes it arguably his most potent aerial, due to the number of moves that can combo into it. Down aerial can pressure shields and can lead into other aerials if autocanceled. The landing hit launches opponents at a low angle and can setup into up smash as a KO confirm. His grab and throw game is below average but is nonetheless an important part of Fox's arsenal. Fox's grab is fast and has decent ending lag, but has low range, requiring Fox to be very close to the opponent. His pummel, while weak, is very fast, allowing him to slightly damage the opponent before throwing and is effective for unstaling other moves. None of his throws are true combo starters (barring down throw at low percentages if the opponent DIs in), but can help with setting up juggles and combos if the opponent's reaction is read properly. Fox's special moves have several uses. His Blaster, while it lacks hitstun and deals low damage at a longer range, is quick and helps with forcing approaches while unstaling his moves without drastically reducing the effectiveness of the projectiles. Fox Illusion is one of his two recovery moves, covers a good horizontal distance and doesn't leave him helpless. It can be used to start combos or even KO outright at really high percentages with the grounded version. Fire Fox covers great distance, can be angled and deals high damage if all of the hits connect, and with the high knockback, it can stage spike reckless edge guarders. Reflector is quick, reflects projectiles and is one of the only reflectors that can be held indefinitely. It has intangibility and a hitbox on startup, which can help with breaking out of combos or gimping weak recoveries offstage. It also reduces Fox's falling speed, giving him landing or recovery mix-up potential. Fox has good KO potential despite his attributes. Fox's up smash has quick startup, high knockback on clean hit, good range and even has setups into it, making it his primary KO move. Forward smash, while fairly weak at lower percentages, has decent knockback growth and end lag. It's best used for punishing the regular ledge getup because of the good range and lasting hitbox. Down smash is his quickest smash attack, which makes it useful for covering rolls. It can also 2-frame punish the opponents, all while sending them at a semispike angle. Up aerial deals high knockback and can KO at reasonable percentages if the opponent is above the ground. Back aerial, while noticeably weaker compared to his fellow Star Fox characters Falco and Wolf, still has decent knockback and launches at a semi-spike angle, and is his safest KO move.","However, Fox has several notable weaknesses. His primary weaknesses are endurance and recovery. He's the fifth lightest character in the game, in addition to being taller than other characters in his weight class (though still relatively small) and has the highest falling speed and gravity, which makes him extremely susceptible to combos and getting KO'd early, which gives him a terrible disadvantage state and one of the worst survivabilities out of all the cast. His recovery, while covering a great distance, is nonetheless linear and predictable. Fox Illusion can't be angled and can only change the drift after the hitboxes end, which can be intercepted with most moves. Fire Fox has very slow startup and is linear, which makes him very vulnerable to stage spikes and meteor smashes and causes him to get KO'd extremely early offstage. Reflector can only stall once, which lessens the mix-up options. His air dodges have among the shortest distances in the game, making them ineffective for the recovery, and coupled with the falling speed, air dodging below the stage is almost always fatal. Despite possessing moves with high knockback, he can struggle KOing the opponents. Up smash has high-end lag and is hard to land without a read or setup. Neutral aerial, which is used to KO confirm into up smash, can be predictable and only true combos at certain percentages without tumbling the opponent, unless it gets stale, while down aerial has high landing lag and can sometimes send the opponents at a different angle. Forward or down smash are also hard to land and deal unimpressive knockback at mid-high percentages, and the latter has low reach. Up aerial is predictable, has narrow hitboxes, can stale if used frequently and the second hit can sometimes even miss after hitting with the first one. Back aerial has a small hitbox, short duration, and is angled somewhat high, making it hard to land, especially on short characters. All of his KO moves deal unimpressive shield damage, and because the moves can stale on shield, this can make the opponent shield more often and cause his moves to KO even later. Fox Illusion stops on shield, which can make it punishable if used predictably. In addition, none of his throws are viable KO options, which further exacerbates the unreliability of KOing. Since he has high falling speed, high-end lag on his aerials and slow vertical recovery, edge guarding with Fox is risky and can put him in an even more vulnerable position. In addition, while rage can help with KOing to a certain extent, he doesn't benefit from it as much as heavier characters, who can usually survive for much longer and gain more rage in return. ","Overall, Fox is a glass cannon character. He can approach the opponents with his proficient movement and attack speed along with a decent damage output for a rushdown character, which allows him to quickly deal high damage to opponents and KO them with several of his finishers. However, the player must stay unpredictable and not let himself get punished, otherwise, he himself can suffer from high damaging combos and get KOd very early."
Diddy,2,8.887,"Diddy Kong is currently ranked 9th out of 82 characters on the current Ultimate tier list, ranking him in S- tier. This is a slight drop from his ranking in Smash 4, where he was tied with Cloud at 2nd/3rd out of 54, and is technically his lowest placement in the series. Diddy Kong possesses many strengths that are core to his gameplan. He has a strong neutral with his signature item being the Banana Peel. It offers him an extensive and flexible array of options at his disposal, using it for combos or setups into KOs or edgeguards. His small size makes him generally hard to hit or pin down. Diddy Kong also has good frame data on his moves, allowing him to box out his opponents at ease. He also possesses a command grab which can also be a burst option in Monkey Flip to condition foes to shield. Despite these strengths, Diddy Kong has some weaknesses. For example, since his Banana is an item, opponents can use it against him, allowing for their own combo or KO confirm on Diddy. Diddy Kong also does not have many reliable ways to secure stocks at high percents if his opponents are past KO confirm percentages, which is further exacerbated by his light stature as he cannot take advantage of rage as effectively, making him rely on stray hits. Finally, his recovery is relatively exploitable as if he gets hit during Rocketbarrel Boost, he is in a lot of endlag until he can recover again. Overall, while Diddy has a lot of strengths to contend with the best of the best, he has some weaknesses that can be exploited from players who know the matchup. He has seen strong tournament results from most notably Tweek, who has won several majors with him, and other players, such as Aaron and Ryuoh.","Diddy Kong is a small middleweight with typical attributes for his weight class; he has very fast dash, run, and walk speeds, which allows him to move on the ground very well. In contrast, his air mobility is rather lacking, as his air speed and air acceleration are both below average. Overall, while Diddy outspeeds many characters on the ground, his air game is rather clunky due to his lackluster air attributes.","Similar to other characters of his weight and size, Diddy Kong has very fast frame data, which allows him to throw out a flurry of moves at his opponent while still being able to chase them with his strong grounded mobility. In fact, nearly all of his moves, with the exception of his forward smash, down aerial, and special moves, come out before frame 10, with many of them also having low endlag. Thanks to these attributes, Diddy has a strong, flexible combo game, allowing him to use multiple different moves to string into each other and continually pressure his opponent even if they escape his combos, as he has multiple ways to keep them in a disadvantageous position. Another important aspect of Diddy's combo game is his excellent selection of combo starters, which lets him start combos reliably both in the air and on the ground and also lets him create mix-ups and play unpredictably. One of his main combo starters is from a grab, as both his down and up throws have low endlag and send at great angles for immediate follow-ups, as down throw can lead into a forward or back aerial and up throw can lead into any of his aerials except for down aerial. Up throw also has potential KO setups into up aerial, although these are inconsistent and unreliable. His dash attack has a long duration and extremely low endlag and sends the opponent upwards, which lets Diddy follow up with an up, back or forward aerial. His neutral aerial has a long lasting hitbox and can lead into another aerial from low to high percents, with the late hit being particularly useful at high percents due to its lower knockback. Diddy's up and down tilts are both excellent combo starters themselves, with the latter having the ability to KO confirm into an up-smash at high percents. Additionally, all of Diddy's aerials except for neutral and up aerial can lead into a grab when landed on grounded opponents thanks to their low knockback and landing lag. Diddy's special moveset also comes with several unique options. His neutral special, Peanut Popgun, is a small projectile with low range and knockback when uncharged. It is useful for pestering the opponent in the neutral game and can be charged, giving it extreme power when fully charged, although it has extremely high lag, doesn't shoot at a distance, and its charge cannot be saved like other chargeable projectiles(such as Samus' Charge Shot). He can also cancel charging the move by shielding, dodging, or spotdodging. His side special, Monkey Flip, has Diddy leap forward and will act as a command grab when landed on the opponent or will be a fast kick if the player presses the attack button again during the duration of the move. Due to its fast speed and decent distance, low endlag, and ability to edge-cancel off platforms or the ledge of the stage, it can be used as both a movement option and a way to approach, as its speed can compensate for his poor air mobility. It can also be used for horizontal recovery. His up special, Rocketbarrel Boost, is Diddy's main vertical recovery option. Uncharged, the move has unremarkable distance, but when fully charged, it moves much faster and travels much further. However, this requires Diddy to stay in place while charging the move in the air, leaving him highly vulnerable to gimps or edgeguards. The move also has a unique property in that if the opponent hits Diddy while using the move, the barrels will fly off and will irregularly move around, with the player having a small amount of control over their trajectory before they lose control. This gives him a useful, although niche stage-controlling option and the barrels will deal high damage and knockback when landed on an opponent. Lastly, Diddy's down special, Banana Peel is his most useful special and one of his best moves. It has him pull out a Banana Peel over himself, which can be picked up and thrown by both Diddy and his opponent. If Diddy places it down before the opponent could grab it, then they will be tripped by it if they attempt to pick it up. This lets Diddy land almost any attack he wants on his opponent if he times it before the tripping animation is done and allows for a plethora of combo options and even KO confirms into his smash attacks. Thanks to its ease of use and low commitment due to him only having to throw it at the opponent for it to work, it is integral to his kit and lets him punish missed attacks, have a strong advantage in the neutral game, create extremely long combos, and take control of the stage. He can also use a held banana as an excellent out-of-shield option when thrown. The only true downside to his Banana Peel is that the opponent can also catch and throw it just like he can, which allows them to use it against Diddy and take away one of his most important tools. Additionally, only one Banana Peel can be used at a time and it disappears when hit by an opponent or thrown twice.","Despite very strong strengths, Diddy isn't without his weaknesses. His two main flaws are a lackluster disadvantage state and predictable recovery. Monkey Flip, while fast, can be extremely predictable when used in a disadvantagous position, as it is Diddy's main way of getting out of juggle situations, due to his horrible air mobility. Diddy especially suffers when the opponent is able to consistently keep him in disadvantage state, not allowing banana to be pulled. This can snowball in some matchups, making it extremely hard to catch up to the opponent if diddy is not able to get his gameplan started. Diddy's other main weakness, his recovery, is arguably worse however. Monkey Flip has respectable distance and safety when the kick version is used, but has some endlag and also doesn't allow him to use Rocketbarrel Boost afterwards. Rocketbarrel Boost itself grants Diddy a relatively long ranged recovery option, the drawback being that it leaves Diddy wide open for attacks. If diddy is hit out of the Rocketbarrel Boost with a weak move he will become helpless and slowly fall to his death, making it easy to gimp him. Diddy Kong also suffers from a lack of range, though this is somewhat offset by his banana, which provides him with a fast and transcendent projectile. Diddy Kong falls into a quick, bait and punish heavy playstyle. He must control the neutral game with his banana and great ground moves, capitalising on his opponents' mistakes by repeatedly getting them offstage or juggling them to rack up damage. Diddy can use his fast and non-committal down tilt to set up for kills at high percent or use his banana to set up for a smash attack, ending the opponents' stock even earlier. However, players must be smart in how they use his Banana Peel, as the opponent could potentially hinder his options by taking it away from him and also exploiting his linear recovery. ","Overall, his strengths outweigh his weaknesses and is generally considered to be a solid high tier-, or even top tier character. Diddy has also seen great results and representation in competitive play, indicating that he is still a very viable character, although not to the same extent as in Smash 4."
Joker,2,8.827,"Joker is ranked 10th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the end of the S- tier and making him the highest ranking character from Fighters Pass Vol. 1. Joker boasts a plethora of amazing strengths, such as his mobility, frame data, safe moves, pressure, and a solid combo game. Joker has many fast attacks that are core to his archetype as a rushdown fighter. He also has a variety of ways to edgeguard his opponent, with back aerial, down Gun, forward aerial, neutral aerial, and more. His strengths can be further enhanced after his Rebellion Gauge has been filled up, as he'll unleash his Persona ArsÃ¨ne. ArsÃ¨ne buffs nearly all his moves, giving him many KO options for a short time. His specials also get upgraded, improving their ability to rack up damage and replacing Rebel's Guard with Tetrakarn and Makarakarn, which serve as a simultaneous counter and reflector. Despite all of these pros, Joker has some cons. One of his main weaknesses is that he sometimes struggles to take stocks at high percents when he does not have ArsÃ¨ne, making him reliant on edgeguards or raw KO moves. Joker also has mediocre out of shield options compared to much of the cast. This only limits him to using back aerial, grab, and up smash if he wants to attack out of shield. While ArsÃ¨ne gives him many strengths, they also provide a few drawbacks. When Joker gets hit in this state, his meter depletes faster. Furthermore, while his recovery goes further with Wings of Rebellion, it lacks a hitbox after the invincibility frames, allowing him to be 2 framed or edgeguarded. Joker is also quite a difficult character to master since he has to be precise with his combos and his edgeguarding while trying to compensate for these aforementioned weaknesses. Overall, Joker's strengths outweigh his weaknesses, and he has since become one of the most popular characters in competitive play, having amassed impressive results from players such as MkLeo and Zackray. Even after MkLeo dropped the character for a few years and Zackray's activity decreased, Joker's representation remained high thanks to the rise of many new players, most notably Tsubaki.","Joker is a middleweight who can wall jump. He boasts very quick mobility, with a fast dashing speed; above-average walking, air, and falling speeds; the 4th highest fast fall speed; above-average air acceleration; and high gravity, though his initial dash is merely average. His slender frame gives him a thinner and slightly shorter hurtbox compared to other humanoid characters, which, in conjunction with his quick speed makes Joker hard to punish, and hard to hit.","One of Joker's biggest strengths is his frame data. Many of Joker's attacks possess fast startup and, with the exception of his smash attacks, low ending lag. This synergizes well with his excellent mobility and thin hurtbox since a lot of his attacks can cross up on shield or just cross up on opponents in general thanks to this. Due to his quick overall mobility, low-knockback attacks, and frame data, Joker possesses a strong and varied combo game. He has several moves in his toolkit to start combos at low percents, such as his up and down throws, a late down tilt, up tilt, his Grappling Hook, the first hit of his forward aerial and the looping hits of up aerial. Some of these combo starters last well into later percentages. Joker also possesses among the best grab frame data (comparable to that of Mario), which makes him especially adept at punishing shields (particularly from empty jumps). Thanks to his fast frame data, most aspects of Joker's moveset are tailored towards comboing, giving him an overall solid regular kit. His grounded game possesses the overall faster frame data around his moveset, with his neutral attack, all tilt attacks, and dash attack all coming out before frame 10. Neutral attack is his fastest punishing option, serving as well as a ""get off me"" move. Forward tilt has the highest power of his tilt attacks and, while still weak, has the lowest ending lag of them, making it hard to punish. His up and down tilt serve similar purposes: placing the opponent in the air to start a combo. Down tilt also serves well as a long-ranged punish option (similarly to Cloud's own down-tilt), whereas up tilt is also one of Joker's many anti-air moves. None of Joker's smash attacks come out before frame 10, though they nevertheless remain decently fast. Forward smash has the highest power of them (although its hitboxes can be quite misleading as it will only hit in front of Joker), and up smash is his fastest smash attack as well as his strongest anti-air move. Down smash is somewhat less versatile than his other smash attacks, although it hits on both sides and can serve as a faster alternative to forward smash. Joker's aerial game is comparably effective as his grounded game, with a variety of different options at his disposal. Back aerial serves as Joker's most versatile aerial, functioning as his best defensive aerial due to its effectiveness out of shield, as a spacing tool due to its good range, and as his best aerial pressuring and KOing move thanks to its very low lag. Both forward and up aerials are among his best combo moves, the former's first hit leading into other moves due to its high base knockback, most notably granting him a kill confirm, whereas the latter's looping hits can set up for another grab at medium percentages or an up or down smash at high ones. Both moves' finishing hits also serve as good combo finishers outside of these ranges, with forward aerial also leading into RAR back aerial, and up aerial putting the opponent in the perfect position to be hit by Grappling Hook if they do not react in time. Up aerial can also serve as a useful anti-air move and is Joker's fastest out of shield option, making him surprisingly harder to cross-up. Neutral and down aerials have the slowest startup of his aerial moves, although they have decently low landing lag and can lead to other moves when used appropriately. Neutral aerial, in particular, has the best range and combo ability of the two, both covering a wide area around Joker and sending at a high enough angle for followups. It's also Joker's best crossup tool, allowing him to pressure shields and be safe against most opponents if he manages to land behind them. His grab game is similar in terms of utility, with a lack of raw KOing options but fantastic for combos. Both up and down throws serve as combo throws, the former leading into up aerial, while the latter is slightly more versatile as it can lead into forward and up aerials or a RAR back aerial. Surprisingly, this is also Joker's strongest throw, though it doesn't KO until well past realistic percentages. Nonetheless, it's useful in a pinch, should Joker find himself in a situation where he struggles to finish off an opponent after dealing considerable damage. His forward throw is the least useful of his throws, serving primarily for setting up and edgeguard and/or putting the opponent at a disadvantage from where Joker can capitalize. Back throw has aspects of both his forward and down throws, mainly used to set up and edgeguard or put the opponent in a disadvantageous position at low percentages, while KOing near the edge at very high percentages. Finally, Joker boasts versatile special attacks. His neutral special, Gun, is an efficient way of dealing damage at long ranges while also avoiding it, as he can dash during the move to dodge in between shots, and its grounded jumping and downward aerial versions are notorious for their versatility, the former allowing Joker to combat rush downs and/or zone breaking, and the latter being used to combat juggling. Eiha, his side special, is Joker's only projectile, being medium-ranged and slow-moving, dealing weak damage upon contact while cursing opponents for reliable damage over time. It's excellent for spacing and forces the opponent to respect Joker by shielding, making it a useful tool for conditioning the opponent to shield, allowing him to appropriately punish with a grab. Grappling Hook, his up special, is fairly niche outside of recovery, but can still be used in an offensive manner; grounded, it's one of Joker's most effective anti-air moves, and while typically not guaranteed, opponents who aren't expecting it can be caught after an up throw loops. In the air, this is Joker's primary recovery move, being a tether recovery with very high vertical reach, allowing him to mix up his recovery and usually avoid edgeguarding attempts. It also allows him to safely edgeguard opponents far below the stage and recover without much issue. Joker possesses a fighter ability unique to him in the form of Rebellion Gauge. This gauge fills up each time Joker takes damage, one of his teammates takes damage, or one of his teammates is KO'd (the latter two happenings during team battles). Joker will also respawn with some of the Rebellion Gauge filled up if he gets KO'd. His down special, Rebel's Guard, helps Joker during this, by negating the knockback he would receive from an attack and halving the damage he takes while filling up the Rebellion Gauge; this move also doubles as a counterattack, albeit a very weak one (similarly to Incineroar's Revenge) by knocking nearby opponents away. Once the Rebellion Gauge is filled up, Joker summons his Persona, ArsÃ¨ne, to aid him in battle, similarly to Rosalina's Luma. With ArsÃ¨ne present, Joker's regular attacks gain a significant boost in damage (and thus safety on shield) and knockback, as well as slightly more range, and his down aerial gains the ability to meteor smash, giving him an additional edgeguarding tool. ArsÃ¨ne is completely invincible during any move boosted by him, which means opponents can't make him disappear without hitting Joker, which is the only way to deplete the Rebellion Gauge faster. Similarly to Cloud's Limit Break, Joker's special moves also become more powerful under ArsÃ¨ne's influence. Gun becomes Gun Special, which can shoot multiple times quickly and deals more than twice as much damage. Eiha becomes Eigaon, a much faster projectile that travels further and has a larger area of impact, explodes on contact with an opponent or solid ground, and deals considerably more curse damage. Its speed and range make it effective for punishing opponents at a distance or pressuring opponents who attempt to edgeguard Joker. It also deals considerable damage as well, making it a highly potent punish tool. Grappling Hook is replaced with Wings of Rebellion, which functions similarly to Pit's Power of Flight, granting Joker high vertical distance and possessing long-lasting invincibility during startup (that starts on frame 1 on the ground), though it loses Grappling Hook's attack presence. Finally, his down special becomes Tetrakarn/Makarakarn, a very effective counterattack and reflector similar to Palutena's Counter/Reflect Barrier. Both counters are better than comparative moves as well; both have very low startup lag (with Tetrakarn having the fastest startup of any counterattack) and the lowest ending lag of any counterattack. Tetrakarn has a huge hitbox that completely covers Joker's body and a huge area around him, and has the strongest damage multiplier of any counterattack at 1.6x (while also hitting for a minimum of 12% damage regardless of the attack). Meanwhile, Makarakarn has the third-highest damage multiplier of any reflector at 1.6x, and also greatly increases the speed of reflected projectiles at 1.9x.","Despite all of these strengths, Joker is not without any weaknesses, most of which are noticeable when he does not have ArsÃ¨ne active. The most notable of these is the lack of strength on individual hits; as similarly to Sheik, most of Joker's default moveset is tailored towards extending his advantage through combos, most of them tend to be highly lackluster or underwhelming in terms of KO power and individual damage. Particularly, Joker's lack of KO power can often make him reliant on gimping the opponent at early percentages, and his smash attacks, while having enough power to secure a stock against light and middleweight characters, have high ending lag, and are heavily unsafe if shielded; as a result, Joker can be very susceptible to comebacks if he is not able to summon ArsÃ¨ne in time. His knife, while giving his attacks disjointed range, also renders said disjointed range short due to its length, especially when compared to the weapons of other fighters such as Marth and Ike. His range issues can also cause him to struggle against certain small and fast characters, such as Inkling and Pikachu, as it's difficult for him to consistently apply pressure against them. He is also vulnerable to projectile-based pressure due to his lack of ways to deal with projectiles, with Eiha failing to properly compensate. Rebel's Guard can aid with this issue, but this can also render him predictable if the move is overused. Although Joker's moves are relegated to comboing, some of Joker's individual moves particularly lack much utility, with the most notable being his down aerial without ArsÃ¨ne. When it comes to his normal recovery, Joker is reliant on his Grappling Hook, which gives him an outstanding vertical recovery, though his overall horizontal recovery is somewhat exploitable due to its lack of horizontal range. Its lack of safety makes Joker easier to gimp as well, though Joker can mix up the timing when recovering to throw off edgeguarding attempts. He can also use his Gun move to achieve sizable horizontal distance before employing the Grappling Hook, however, these dashes have considerable ending lag, so they must be used wisely. Since the Rebellion Gauge encourages a different kind of playstyle, Joker loses on some of his weaknesses without ArsÃ¨ne (such as a vulnerability to projectile camping), but this creates new weaknesses in return, meaning that if Joker gets ArsÃ¨ne at the wrong time or is unable to capitalize with him, he may either lose his advantage or be at a disadvantage. Wings of Rebellion, despite reliably covering more distance than Grappling Hook, is more exploitable, as the lack of hitbox and vulnerability at the end of the move makes it easy for opponents to intercept Joker before he reaches the ledge; in fact, Joker becomes notoriously prone to getting 2-framed. Eigaon, while incredibly powerful and versatile, suffers from 10 more frames of endlag, making it (at times) riskier to use than Eiha. Lastly, despite ArsÃ¨ne's incredible power and strengths, the Rebellion Gauge can be depleted faster if an opponent is able to attack Joker; combined with his aforementioned vulnerability to combos, this can cause ArsÃ¨ne to disappear much faster until the Rebellion Gauge is filled again, removing Joker's advantage as a result. ","Overall, Joker is a character whose playstyle is incredibly dynamic, but as with characters with many playstyles applicable, players should be expected to be able to smartly switch playstyles on the go. Without ArsÃ¨ne, Joker specializes in a hit-and-run, combo-oriented playstyle. Joker is particularly adept at conditioning the opponent to shield and has excellent grab frame data to take advantage of that, so players should be looking for opportunities to go for punishing grab combos whenever possible. He has notably short-range and low power overall on his standard attacks without ArsÃ¨ne available, and can struggle if he's a stock behind the opponent and unable to effectively make use of ArsÃ¨ne. His primary goal in each match is to rack up as much damage as possible through combos and gain an early stock in order to massively widen the gap between him and his opponent. ArsÃ¨ne greatly helps Joker in dealing damage or securing a stock whenever he is out, as he gains several powerful traits that allow him to play more rushdown-oriented when he gains the advantage, without forgoing his excellent mobility. ArsÃ¨ne is also notable for giving Joker an absurdly effective comeback factor, as Joker can quickly close the gap by dealing out extreme damage with ArsÃ¨ne out and can KO early when given the opportunity, such as with an ArsÃ¨ne boosted back air. By actively filling up the Rebellion Gauge by using Rebel's Guard to capitalize on reading an opponent's attack, this can be devastating for the opponent, as it gives ArsÃ¨ne more opportunity to be seen in-game. At the same time, Joker's vulnerability to combos means he will have to make use of his excellent mobility more often than not to avoid being put at a disadvantage. Ultimately, Joker is a character who encourages proactive play, and particularly shines when players are able to make the most of edgeguarding opportunities, maximize their damage through combos and effectively make use of ArsÃ¨ne."
Kazuya ,3,8.638,"Kazuya ranks 11th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the top of the A+ tier. Kazuya possesses various strengths, the most significant being his deadly punish and combo game. He has a plethora of combo starters, including down throw, uncrouching attack, down-back tilt, and Electric Wind God Fist, the latter being one of the best combo starters in the game; likewise he has many powerful combo finishers, including up smash, Devil Wings, and Dragon Uppercut. As he also has a high overall damage output, this means he has several zero-to-death combos that are usually difficult to escape when perfectly executed. In addition, his damage output is increased when Rage is activated, which not only increases his damage output but also grants him a stronger variant of Heaven's Door, Rage Drive. All of these strengths makes Kazuya one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, character to fight on the ground. However, Kazuya suffers from several polarizing weaknesses, the most significant being his poor frame data, extremely slow mobility, and poor defense. Almost all of his attacks, from combo and KO moves, come out on at least frame 12 and have very high ending lag, making most of his attacks unsafe on shield. He is also among the slowest characters in the game, possessing slow ground speed, air speed, and mobility if he is not constantly using Crouch Dash. When coupled with his low range and very slow jumpsquat (which is uniquely 7 frames instead of the universal 3 frames), this forces Kazuya to actively approach with grounded options and gives him a poor disadvantage state, due to his jump being a poor disengagement option while also lacking effective aerial combo breakers. His advantage state is also mediocre, as he primarily relies on connecting combos to succeed: if his combo drops halfway, he usually has to win neutral again, and his offstage abilities are sub-par due to his slow speed and few aerial options, which prevents him from netting early kills offstage outside of certain ground combos. Rage also has its drawbacks, as it can be lost after Kazuya takes enough damage, enough time passes, or too many uses of Rage Drive are attempted. Lastly, Kazuya's recovery is relatively exploitable due to its overall high lag, allowing opponents to punish him if he is careless. Overall, Kazuya's attributes provide a unique gameplay style in Ultimate: mastering his kit grants access to a hard-hitting ground offense with heavy punishment and comeback potential, and similar to his appearances in Tekken, his combos can often be long and heavily-damaging and he offers significant KO potential. However, his own weaknesses mean that if he misses an opening, he can find himself struggling to regain footing, while his sluggish frame data and poor disadvantage makes him equally as vulnerable to being overwhelmed. Utilizing him at his strongest is difficult due to the technical skill required and his large moveset, though Kazuya's strengths have been showcased through excellent results from players such as Riddles and Tea. Kazuya's strong strengths and ""touch of death"" punish game have led some to call for his ban, although this has not affected his legality outside of certain local regions.","Kazuya is a surprisingly heavy brawler, being the 8th heaviest character in the game, who focuses heavily on ground offense, courtesy of his wide array of grounded moves and command specials which consists of almost nothing but grabs, throws, punches, and kicks. Reflecting both his weight class and series of origin, many of his attacks possess astounding damage outputs and knockback values, though both his movement and attack speed are lackluster, which renders his approach relatively limited. He possesses an impressive variety of microspacing options and ways to close in the distance, including a kick capable of reflection, a quick dash that grants intangibility, and attacks that move him slightly forward or backwards, allowing him to control his grounded movements better than most of the cast. His attributes reflect his ground-focused playstyle, as Kazuya's movement speed is very sluggish in general and requires use of his kit to properly close the distance. Apart from a very high double jump (similar to Mewtwo or Ness), Kazuya's dash speed is below average, and his air and walk speeds are very slow. Kazuya also possesses one of the lowest jumps in the game: while this assists his combo game due to his attacks' launch angles, this is counterbalanced by his jumpsquat, which is uniquely 7 frames long instead of 3.","Kazuya's most noteworthy attribute is arguably his comeback mechanic in the form of Rage. This is an ability that activates when Kazuya takes 100% (or is down to 25% of his health in Stamina mode), which grants a multitude of buffs. To start off, Kazuya's damage output on all of his attacks increases by 1.1Ã—, which improves his already outstanding damage output and combo game. He also gains a strengthened version of Heaven's Door called Rage Drive, which deals massive damage and can KO most characters before 80% near the ledge. Acting as a command grab, this makes Kazuya very threatening to shield against or even approach, as his high damage capabilities grant him the ability to net stocks starting at very early percentages. Much like how his fighting style reflects and based on his playstyle in his home series, one of Kazuya's biggest strengths is his punish game once he closes the gap. It is possible for him to dish out large amounts of damage due to his very large and varied moveset. His kit is filled with numerous combo starters that deal high damage and hitstun, and several of his attacks are able to be interrupted halfway through, which creates multiple combo routes to go by, with even the more simple ones being able to dish out at least 30%. The most notable is Electric Wind God Fist: while it is very difficult to time due to its near-perfect frame requirement, the move's high paralysis effect and hitstun causes near a full second of vulnerability while disables opponents from escaping via SDI, allowing Kazuya to connect his combos with a myriad of followups, including KO moves like up smash. He also has options that counter shields, such as shield-breaking options with down smash and Tsunami Kick, as well as some attacks that outright beat shields, such as the last hit of the 10-hit Combo, and Electric Wind God Fist, which uniquely forces opponents out of their shield. Additionally, many of his ground moves have high shieldstun multipliers, making them surprisingly safe on shield if properly spaced in spite of their high lag. This gives Kazuya a very strong close-range game once he does close the gap, as his kit is filled with mixups and routes which leaves the opponent on their toes, having to keep guessing what he's going to do next. While his aerial movement is very lackluster, Kazuya's aerials in their own right have varied uses. Neutral aerial is unique in that it meteor smashes both grounded and aerial opponents, while also being very quick to interrupt, granting it the ability to combo into other attacks almost flawlessly, rising or landing with the move. Forward aerial has a similar attribute of being very quick to interrupt, but also has decent horizontal range in front of Kazuya while having respectable knockback, making it useful as a poking option and combo starter overall. Back aerial is the hardest aerial for Kazuya to use consistently due to his auto-turnaround mechanic in 1v1 fights, although it is also his strongest aerial. It deals high damage, has good range and KOs rather early when sweetspotted, making it a viable mixup in his kit. His up aerial has a very wide vertical range, hitting grounded opponents even when rising with the move. Like neutral and forward aerials, it is a fast aerial overall, having numerous combo routes out of the move. It also boasts good KO power when it hits clean. Lastly, down aerial is a stall-and-fall aerial that is risky when used offstage, but it deals high knockback, creating a large area of denial for the opponent attempting to get back to the stage. It also has low enough ending lag for Kazuya to be able to recover back to the stage afterwards, provided he has his double jump. Kazuya's special attacks are unique, and further support his playstyle. Devil Blaster is a long-ranged projectile attack, similar to Robo Beam. It can be angled and deals good damage with respectable knockback to back it up, which makes it good for long-range edgeguarding and keeping the opponent away from the stage, while occasionally being able to net KOs from a long distance. His side special, Devil Fist, is an excellent combo starter that crumples opponents on a clean hit. It also grants Kazuya a horizontal recovery option, albeit a short-range one. His up special, Devil Wings, travels a moderately high distance and is one of the only up specials in the game to not put the character into a helplessness state, which grants Kazuya many recovery mixups. It also has a hitbox that is at its strongest when hit clean, being able to be used as a combo finisher and KO confirm. Lastly, Heaven's Door is a command grab that acts extremely similar to Flying Slam. It is capable of being controlled in the air, and the slam is very powerful and capable of KOing at high percentages.","However, Kazuya's flaws aren't to be overlooked. To start off, due to being a heavyweight when it comes to weight class and having an above average standing height, he is very susceptible to combos. He has a hard time dealing with pressure due to the rather poor startup of most of his attacks, and his out-of-shield game is rather lackluster due to his unique 7-frame jumpsquat heavily hindering the potential for his aerials to be effective out-of-shield, save for up air, which is frame 4 and frame 11 when shorthop buffered. His up smash and Devil Wings both have a 12-frame startup, which is still below-average speed for an out-of-shield option. This is also supplemented by his poor mobility overall, with his running speed being below average, and his walking speed, initial dash, and particularly his air speed being bottom 10 in the game or worse. This gives him a poor ground-to-air transitioning that most other fighters do not share. Kazuya's recovery can also be exploitable, despite its coverage. While having a high double jump and an up special that covers a decent distance, Kazuya's horizontal recovery options are subpar. Not only is Kazuya's air speed bottom 10 in the game along with a very slow air acceleration, his side special Devil Fist has a short travel distance in the air and very high ending lag, making it very risky to use if he is not close to the ledge; in this situation, either Kazuya won't be able to make it and suffer from its high lag, or the opponent can fend off the recovery attempt only for it to happen again. Devil Wings travels an average distance, and while it has a powerful hitbox and doesn't put Kazuya in a helplessness state, it is still prone to getting countered. Additionally, Devil Wings' ending lag is high enough to where a directional air dodge is rendered useless to try to gain extra vertical distance, meaning that Kazuya would have to recover in an area that is above the ledge (and thus, leave more of an opening) in order to get the most out of his options. To top it all off, Kazuya's aerials cancel almost all the momentum of his otherwise high double jump, which significantly worsens his chances of fending off opponents with his aerials who try to intercept his recovery. Additionally, Kazuya's unique Rage mechanic has its own downsides. It does not last forever, as landing Rage Drive instantly consumes it, and whiffing a grab reduces the damage needed to take to lose it, eventually ending Rage upon too many whiffed grabs. Kazuya has to pick his positions well in order to best utilize Rage Drive, as too many whiffed grabs can potentially determine the outcome of his combo strings. It also goes away upon taking enough damage, which means that Kazuya has to avoid being hit if he wants to sustain the additional buffs received, which is already hard due to his status as a super-heavyweight with a large frame and poor mobility. Lastly, Kazuya's vast and large moveset grants him among the highest technical learning curves in the game. He doesn't have the ability to ""cancel"" his attacks unlike fellow fighting game characters Ryu, Ken and Terry, meaning that he has to be more precise and frame-tight with his combos compared to other characters. His wide range of attacks all have specific inputs and timings, most notably Electric Wind God Fist, which is extremely useful when mastered but can take a lot of practice to pull off consistently, making Kazuya particularly prone to misinputs and their associated consequences. In addition, improper inputs can be especially common when dealing with fast opponents who can easily cross up Kazuya, and many of his tilts are fairly sluggish, which in combination with his lack of approach options means he cannot afford to be impatient in neutral. This forces the player to adapt to Kazuya's unique playstyle and learn the ins and outs of every move, carefully anticipate the right time to use a certain attack to avoid being left vulnerable, and see what is most optimal to string together to maximize his considerable damage potential.","All in all, like other characters of his weight class, Kazuya functions as a bait-and-punish type of character akin to how he plays in Tekken, though uniquely with plenty of combo routes and punishment options that differentiate him from other heavyweights. His ability to dish out extreme amounts of damage, sometimes more than characters heavier than him, combined with his ability to close the gap with some of his moves, such as his Crouch Dash, forces the opponent to stay on their toes against Kazuya. Once he is able to close the gap, it is often hard for the opponent to keep up in damage. However, Kazuya himself is very prone to combos and his rather sluggish startup on his attacks means that he must pick his spots well; coupled with his mediocre aerial abilities and Ultimate's heavy focus on aerial combat, he can easily get overwhelmed on certain stages or against opponents with strong air games. Regardless, his high skill ceiling and formidable grounded abilities supplements this a lot, making him a very rewarding character when played in the right hands."
Min Min,3,8.565,"Min Min currently ranks 12th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing her in the A+ tier. Min Min's greatest strength is the outstanding amount of melee range granted to her by her ARMS attacks â€” the type of which is traditionally reserved for attacks with projectile properties â€” giving her ample levels of safety to attack opponents from anywhere on the stage and pile on damage with very few interactions. This is complemented by her ability to move and jump while using her regular ranged attacks, making her a deceptively evasive character in neutral that can mix up her spacing and approaches. In addition, Min Min's ability to swap the individual traits of her ARMS-based attacks via ARMS Change gives her extensive neutral game and advantage state options, and also grants her some of the deadliest tech-chasing, edgeguarding, and ledgetrapping options in the game. Finally, Min Min also possesses several close-quarter attacks that have fast startup, high KO power and solid range, allowing her to stand a chance when fighting opponents up close. However, Min Min does sport some flaws. Her primary weakness is her extremely fragile off-stage endurance, as a result of her slow air speed and the relatively short horizontal range of her tether recovery. These traits are compounded by a lack of reliable combo breakers, making her very ineffectual while she is in a disadvantaged state. Several of Min Min's attacks are also highly committal in spite of their fast startup, making her highly whiff punishable at certain ranges. In addition, Min Min's attacks rely on precision due to their hitbox placements being limited to the fist portion of her ARMS, and her relative lack of shield safety means she can struggle against faster characters that can close the distance easier. Despite these drawbacks and game updates nerfing her in a few ways, Min Min's pros largely outweigh her cons, and she has consistently maintained strong representation at all levels of competitive play since her release. She is believed to be able to contend against many characters in the top tier echelon, and has seen notable tournament results courtesy of players such as Dabuz, Doramigi, and ProtoBanham.","Although Min Min's physique is athletic and slender, the ARMS she wields render her as a heavyweight that weighs as much as Link, Yoshi, Captain Falcon, and Mii Gunner. Her base stats are true to this weight class as well, with an average walking speed, the 20th slowest dashing speed, and the 6th slowest air speed. As an ARMS fighter, Min Min's playstyle can be considered a hybrid of Little Mac and Simon's, with an emphasis on both strong punches and keeping foes at a distance. Although her punches have the most melee range of any attack in the game, their hitboxes located strictly on her equipped ARMS, and do not cover her extendable ARMS. As a result, Min Min requires much stricter attack positioning to keep opponents away at a safe distance in comparison to other fighters dependent on spacing, such as Marth or Corrin.","Min Min's biggest strength is arguably the sheer versatility of her moveset. Her down special, ARMS Change, allows her to swap between a trio of ARMS which can be equipped to her right ARM: the Ramram, which is not as powerful as her other ARMS but can be angled in a wider arc; the Megawatt, which lacks in speed and range but compensates with high power; and the Dragon, which can fire a laser if the attack button for Min Min's respective ARM is held down. ARMS Change does not incur any ending lag, allowing her to swap her right ARM instantly as needed, allowing for a potential surprise attack. Min Min can uniquely attack with one ARM and use the other one mid-attack (and can do so in entirely different directions), as the A button triggers attacks with her left ARM, while the B button triggers attacks with her right. This effect also applies to her forward smash attacks, granting her a distinctly high damage dispensing ceiling. While this effectively deprives her of any traditional neutral and side special moves, this gives her a very strong mix-up game: she can use both ARMS to catch foes off guard before attacking, as well as cover a myriad of tech chasing options. She can also jump mid-punch, giving her a decent ground-to-air game, although this is mostly effective when Ramram is active due to its vertical coverage. In the air, Min Min's forward and back aerials retain the same function as they do on the ground, though she uniquely has the ability to perform forward smashes while airborne. This allows her to sport KO potential even in air-to-air engagements, as well as giving her additional unique landing options. Her neutral aerial spins Min Min's left ARM in a circular motion, which can be reliably spaced and used as a defensive option. Uniquely, her airborne neutral special is nearly identical to her neutral aerial, while utilizing her currently equipped right ARM instead of her left. Although the different ARMS sport different traits in terms of startup, speed and active frames, they all have the same amount of landing lag. The Megawatt version of Min Min's airborne neutral special is notably capable of KOing, while the Ramram version can combo into itself at low percentages, and lead into forward and back aerial combos, which in some circumstances may lead to early KOs. One of Min Min's most atypical but valuable perks is her ability to keep pressure and potentially start combos far from harm's way. Being able to consecutively string multiple tilts and forward smashes into one another allows Min Min to hit confirm into extreme amounts of damage from afar with a comparatively few amounts of hits. With the right precision and spacing, Min Min can cause an onslaught of constant attacks that can combo into one another without any risk of retaliation, while continuously remaining in a position to do it again. This is especially dangerous when any character is offstage, as any who try to recover horizontally are at risk of being KO'd even at 0% thanks to the sheer range provided by Min Min's ARMS. Although Min Min is afforded safety from on-stage against horizontal recoveries, the speed of Min Min's attacks in the air grant her plenty of opportunities in edge-guarding from off-stage as well, and ARMS Jump allows her to pursue and edge-guard opponents who recover high. Depending on the currently equipped ARM, Min Min can even beat out oncoming projectiles from characters attempting to pressure her from afar. The core of her security is from the inability to counter an ARM at mid-to-long range in any way that would put her at risk, and no ARM nor any of their effects can be reflected. While punches comprise the bulk of her moveset, Min Min also has a handful of kicks that also have utility. Her down tilt is a sliding kick that, despite its meager damage output, allows her to approach foes reliably due to its speed and distance covered, and it can also start combos. Her dash attack gives her a solid burst option given her lack in mobility, can lead to follow-ups at low percentages, and is able to cross-up shields when used at close range. Her up aerial has a good horizontal range in front of her that makes it good for performing combos on landing, while her down aerial is decently strong and can function as a combo breaker if there is enough vertical distance. Min Min's up smash and down smash have great power when sweetspotted, being very strong KO options. Both Min Min's up smash and up tilt have very fast startup, as well as great vertical range, giving her both a strong out of shield option and useful anti-air. Additionally, her up smash has the unique properties of sporting a reflector hitbox, which is active one frame before its attack hitbox, and has one persistent reflector hitbox in front of her for the duration of the move, as well as moving ones on her legs. Because of the reflector being applied to her up smash, she sports the fastest out of shield reflector in the game, and is able to cover both close-range approaches and point-blank projectile options. Min Min also has a useful grab game; her grab has the second-longest range of all grabs in the game, and each of her throws have worthwhile utility. Her forward throw can force opponents offstage and set up easy tech chase combos at lower percentages, her up and back throws have strong KO potential, and her down throw, despite its inability to start combos reliably, can still follow up if the opponent does not react accordingly. Throwing also has the benefit of charging her left Dragon ARM; this charged up state lasts for â‰ˆ20 seconds (barring the sustaining of heavy knockback), and gives her a damage and knockback boost on any attack made with her left Dragon ARM, including its laser. However, one key flaw with her grab is that it has the longest startup of any grab in the game, and considerable end lag if missed, rendering it a risky option to use in neutral and largely saved for landing and whiff punishing.","Despite all of Min Min's unique perks, her moveset does come with weaknesses. As her ARMS' hitboxes are located on her ""fists"", foes can easily close in on her if she makes a mistake in spacing or timing her punches. While the Ramram's wide curving arc can somewhat alleviate this, its hitboxes are rendered inactive during the last few frames of retraction, requiring her to properly move, time and alternate between ARMS in order to offset her vulnerability, giving her a notably high skill floor. Since this problem is not shared with other range-dependent fighters (such as Shulk), this means that there are bound to be blind spots on Min Min's fist attacks, even against larger characters. One downside to Min Min's more streamlined playstyle is her relative lack of variance between individual moves. Lacking a standard forward tilt and relying on her forward smash, forward aerial and neutral moves means that Min Min's main moves are far more prone to becoming stale compared to other characters. Even with the various ARMS to swap between, their counter-play remains relatively similar across all three. Many of her moves are meant for combat from much greater distances, and while she sports many close-range moves with fast startup as a last line of defense, they are generally plagued with notable end lag, making them highly committal and punishable if whiffed or blocked. This means that characters with fast mobility are particularly difficult for Min Min to fight, especially if they have high damage per second or KO potentials, as she lacks tools to handle them up close and any easy way to keep them at bay without committing to high vulnerability reads. Min Min further suffers from her very poor disadvantage state. She has almost no moves to break out of disadvantage once she is in it, lacking any functional combo breakers outside of situational usage of down and neutral aerials. This, coupled with her slow fall speed, makes her prone to getting juggled. Her up special has a long range as a tether recovery, but will only work if Min Min is sufficiently close to an edge, which means that any stray aerial from any character may be enough to edge-guard and gimp her, even at surprisingly low percentages. This is compounded by her abysmal air speed, which makes both recovering and avoiding repeated attacks all the more difficult. Finally, while she has more range to control and threaten with than any other character, she can occasionally struggle with being conditioned by opponents in the neutral game. Min Min's up smash, despite also doubling as a reflector, is highly committal, making it an inferior option against certain projectile users (such as Mega Man or the Links), as they can pressure her with multiple fast projectiles that her reflector is unable to account for. While her ARMS can beat out weaker projectiles, there are quite a few that either clank or have transcendent priority, which forces her to play aggressively and risk slipping into her poor disadvantageous state. This issue is exacerbated particularly against characters who have reflectors of their own, and are able to reflect their own projectiles back at her.","Overall, Min Min is a character well equipped with unique tools and traits that have her play a hybrid gameplay style, incorporating elements of zoning as well as the aggressive usage of long-ranged attacks. Her fast overall frame data, strong anti-aerial prowess, and ability to alternate between attacks while retaining mobility make for a character who maintains a strong pressure game that can discombobulate opponents, allowing her to mix up her play from multiple angles in deceptive ways. Her ability to switch the traits of her attacks also gives her unique frame trapping and tech-chasing capabilities, as well as a deadly edge-guarding game. This adds up to Min Min having a profound snowball effect whenever she gains advantage in battle. However, the combination of her precision-reliant hitboxes, subpar disadvantage state, punishable frame data on select key moves, and high learning curve collectively mean that Min Min's player has to possess the ingenuity to master precision, proper conditioning, and reads in order to combat opponents who are capable of rushing her down, playing a stronger defensive game, or taking advantage of her blind spots."
Cloud,3,8.537,"Cloud is currently ranked 13th out of 82 characters on the Ultimate tier list, ranking him in A+ tier. This is a minor drop from his ranking in Smash 4, where he was ranked 2nd/3rd out of 54 and was tied with Diddy Kong. Cloud's already great movement was further improved from Smash 4, with his jump squat being lowered to 3 frames and his already safe aerials receiving landing lag reductions, which improved his advantage state and combo game. Despite nerfs to his range, Cloud's hitboxes are still fairly large, especially those that utilize his Buster Sword, allowing him to outrange many characters in Ultimate's roster. Cloud also possesses one of the best out-of-shield options in the game, with his Climhazzard making pressuring him and landing against him rather difficult. Cloud also retains Limit Charge which further improves his special moves when active. However, Cloud still struggles with an underwhelming grab game and an exploitable recovery. He also received drastic nerfs to some of his strengths from the previous game, most notably his specials, some of which deal less knockback, and Limit Break, which now only lasts up to 15 seconds, forcing Cloud to be more cautious when using it. Cloud's ability to kill is also less consistent due to the nerfs to Limit as well as his down aerial no longer being a reliable combo starter. Overall, Cloud is still considered a strong character as he still retains many of his key advantages from Smash 4. While he saw few results at the start of Ultimate's metagame, his representation has since grown tremendously thanks to the efforts of Sparg0, who went on to become one of the best players in the world.","Cloud is a middleweight swordsman, tied with Mii Swordfighter at 100 units of weight. Despite his weight class, Cloud boasts high overall mobility: he has average walking speed, very fast dashing speed, above-average air speed and average air acceleration, which collectively make him quick both on the ground and in the air. Cloud also has above-average falling speed and high gravity, however, which prevent him from staying in the air for long in spite of his good aerial maneuverability.","While under his unique Limit Break status, Cloud's already impressive mobility improves further. His traction slightly improves, his dashing speed becomes even faster, his falling speed becomes the fourth fastest, and his air speed becomes the fastest in the game under normal circumstances. His increased gravity and falling speed, however, make his jumps slightly lower and prevent him from autocanceling some of his aerial attacks (notably back aerial and up aerial) as easily. As a result, Cloud's Limit Break status only marginally benefits his aerial mobility, but it can nevertheless help him move along the ground better. Cloud's greatest asset is his effective range, courtesy of his Buster Sword; Cloud's attacks have among the longest reaches in the game and can space out the opponent quite easily, snuff out opposing approaches and adeptly punish most careless attacks due to his speed and range. A prime example of this trait is Cloud's aerial attacks: neutral aerial, despite having its range decreased noticeably in the transition to Ultimate, still covers Cloud's hurtbox well, making it a go-to option for spacing or air-to-ground transition movement. It is also very fast on both ends, can autocancel with a short hop, and has a low launching angle, all of which make it a good edgeguarding and spacing tool despite its below-average knockback. Up aerial has a rather large hitbox, overall decent speed, a long duration, and decent damage and knockback; altogether, these traits make it effective at juggling and denying landings. Down aerial is not only a very strong meteor smash when sweetspotted, but also possesses a long-lasting late hitbox, which grants it good anti-juggling potential and allows him to follow up into another move if it connects while he is falling. Like up aerial, it also has a long autocancel window, being able to autocancel from a jump regardless of his Limit Break status. Back aerial has tremendous range, decent power, very low landing lag, and autocancels from a short hop; altogether, these traits allow him to edgeguard and space effectively, and even perform a wall of pain at low percentages. However, it can often miss low opponents due to its minimal vertical range. Forward aerial is very strong when its clean, hitbox connects, and its sweetspot is a powerful meteor smash on aerial opponents. Like down aerial, it autocancels from a jump and has low landing lag in relation to its range and power. However, it has the slowest startup of his aerials, making it his riskiest one to use regardless. Cloud's grounded moveset, while much less effective than his aerial moveset, nevertheless has its own merits. Neutral attack is his fastest attack, has decent overall range, and its third hit can force a tech-chase. Forward tilt has serviceable speed and respectable power, which make it a decent KO option at high percentages. However, its moderate ending lag and very low base knockback make it unsafe on hit at low percentages if it not spaced sufficiently. Down tilt is a low-profile sliding kick and is reasonably quick; while these traits make it useful primarily for avoiding projectiles and putting the opponent into a disadvantageous state, its final frames also allow it to combo into his neutral and up aerials at low percentages. Up tilt is a reliable combo starter, as it can combo into itself at low percentages and into neutral, back and up aerials at medium percentages. While it can even combo into up smash at low to medium percentages, this combo is heavily dependent on the opponent's reaction. Dash attack is a quick punishing option from a distance, and its respectable power enables its clean hit to either KO at reasonable percentages or, at worst, put an opponent in an unfavorable position. However, like forward tilt, it is easily punished when shielded or avoided. In regard to Cloud's smash attacks, up smash covers a very large arc, has decent speed, and rather high knockback despite its middling damage output. As a result, it is among his best and least risky KOing options out of his standard moveset. Forward smash is Cloud's most powerful non-Limit Break move, though to compensate it also takes the longest to start and is very punishable if it whiffs. Down smash is also prone to punishment if the front hit is avoided, but it drags the opponent into the back hit if it connects, with the latter being a strong semi-spike. Cloud's special moveset also offers interesting options. Blade Beam is a projectile with good range and activity, making it useful for forcing approaches, though it gets weakened over the duration and has rather high endlag, which hampers its otherwise useful utility. It also stalls Cloud in the air, giving it additional, albeit situational, utility in guard breaking. Cross Slash is similar to Dancing Blade and Double-Edge Dance, as it requires additional inputs from the player to initiate the remaining slashes. In contrast, it has wider input windows, but the full move is only allowed to continue if all hits connect. It can also stall Cloud in the air, just like Blade Beam, though much more briefly. Climhazzard is similar to Aether and Final Cutter, as it is an ascending slash, but differs from them in that it can be followed by an optional descending slash. This allows Cloud to mix-up his recovery and enables Climhazzard to function as his fastest out of shield option, though it is very risky to use. In reference to Final Fantasy VII, Cloud possesses a unique Limit Break mechanic. It is indicated by the Limit Gauge, which is displayed above his damage meter and becomes visible while charging it to show its progress, similarly to the Power Meter. Cloud can charge his Limit Gauge by inflicting 150%, receiving 100%, or by manually charging it for 5.58 seconds via his down special, Limit Charge. Unlike most other chargeable special moves, it can be canceled with a simple special move button press. When the Limit Gauge is full, Cloud gets a boost to all of his movement attributes except for attack speed, allowing him to move very quickly across the stage and in the air, with his overall mobility almost rivaling that of Captain Falcon and Sonic. In addition, all of Cloud's special attacks are given a single-use power boost that enables them to KO reliably around 90%-120%. Limit Charge is also converted to Finishing Touch, a spinning slash with such tremendous knockback that can KO most characters around 60%-70%. It also emits a whirlwind that pushes away opponents, making it harder to punish and providing Cloud a situational method of gimping weak recoveries. With the exception of Finishing Touch, all Limit Break specials are also granted brief intangibility upon start-up, as well as additional properties: Blade Beam is faster, stronger, and gains transcendent priority; Cross Slash requires no additional button inputs and strikes five times immediately, has very low ending lag in relation to its immense power, and stalls Cloud completely in the air; and Climhazzard grants more vertical distance and much more horizontal momentum, as well as having the ability to sweetspot an edge at any time. With all these benefits underneath the Limit Break status, players must be wary of this, as one small slip-up from the opponent can give Cloud the perfect opportunity to strike and turn the tide of battle instantaneously, making Cloud's Limit Break a mechanic that should not be taken lightly when in the hands of a competent player.","However, Cloud has some notable flaws. The most prominent one is his poor recovery; despite his aerial mobility and jump height being arguably better than most sword-wielding characters, his diagonal speed remains slow when compared to them, making him prone to edgeguarding and gimping, and making it mandatory to stay a safe distance within reaching the edge. Climhazzard is also a poor recovery move for many reasons: it grants below average vertical distance, little horizontal momentum, its ascending hit is completely incapable of edge sweetspotting, and its descending hit cannot edge sweetspot until it covers slight distance. The last problem about Cloud's recovery is that if he gets grabbed near the edge and gets air released while lacking access to his double jump, he will not be able to return to the stage unless he properly times a Blade Beam to stall towards the edge, uses aerials or air dodges to reset his momentum, or possesses a Limit Break. These factors make Cloud's recovery among the riskiest and most ineffective without use of his wall jump or Limit Break Climhazzard (which loses the active hitbox near the end of his ascent, making it less safe than the regular Climhazzard in some situations). Another of Cloud's glaring flaws is his terrible grab game, being among the worst in the game. His grabs possess low range while having relatively high startup for a non-tether grab, his throws' damage outputs are mediocre and, barring down throw, they lack combo potential. Forward and back throws' decent speed are significantly offset by the problematic combination of their virtual lack of combo potential and low knockback scaling, both failing to KO before 300% unless the opponent is light, Cloud has rage, and/or is at the edge upon performing them. Back throw can be used as a situational tech-chase option, but even then is largely ineffective in this role. Up and down throws both have misleading power, with the former failing to KO until well beyond 200%. Up throw has too much ending lag to set up combos reliably, while down throw lacks reliable combos at low percentages and loses all of its combo potential past low percentages if the opponent DIs properly due to its more horizontal angle. Ironically, it is also Cloud's only throw that can KO below 200% with exception of up throw KOing slightly earlier on platform stages. Although Cloud's range, combo options and Blade Beam collectively grant him a strong neutral game, he has a below-average approach at best. His approach options are linear: dash attack is easily punishable, neutral aerial's hitbox starts from behind him, and up aerial is very predictable as well as surprisingly punishable on shield if it is not spaced properly. This is further compounded by his other attacks lacking the frame data or the utility to be used as reliable approach options, such as his poor grab game. Cloud also lacks a reliable means of escaping pressure. His neutral attack and down tilt are his fastest ground options, while Climhazzard is a great out of shield option. However, they are noticeably unsafe on shield, while none of his fast aerial attacks start from in front or below him. Down aerial's late hitbox can be used to escape juggling directly from below him, but its otherwise narrow hitbox allows opponents to hit Cloud laterally. Thus, Cloud is fairly easy to combo, and is just as easily forced on the defensive if his attacks are improperly spaced. Although Cloud also possesses an abundance of strong finishers, his KO potential is somewhat inconsistent. None of his strongest finishers are easy to land in the neutral game and they can be easily punished if avoided or shielded. In comparison, his weaker finishers, such as forward tilt and back aerial, require good positioning to KO reliably. Cloud's KO potential is further compounded by his lack of reliable set-ups to combo into his strongest or best finishers. Aside from Limit Charge, Cloud's special moves have some noticeable weaknesses. Blade Beam is relatively slow in regard to start-up and ending lag, as well as depreciating in damage over time or when used in the air, all of which make it less effective for spamming. Cross Slash is inconsistent with linking all five of its hits due to SDI or landing different parts of the hitboxes, along with being very vulnerable to stale-move negation because of its reliability as a damage racking option. In addition to its aforementioned weaknesses in regard to recovery, Climhazzard is also can be punishable if shielded and DI'd out of, while all of his specials only boast KO power when they are boosted by the Limit Break. The Limit Break mechanic itself is also problematic: it acts as a double-edged sword, as it increases Cloud's fall speed and gravity at full charge, making recovery without the use of Climhazzard deceptively difficult, and rendering Cloud even easier to combo at medium percentages. It makes precise use of his special attacks mandatory, as his Limit Break specials can still be blocked and possess limited range. While Limit Blade Beam can be used as a ranged KOing option, it can just as easily be reflected or otherwise avoided at the tip of its range, leaving Cloud wide open to punishment. Finishing Touch deals only 1% and has very high ending lag that renders Cloud vulnerable if the slash or whirlwind do not hit. Finally and most notably, his Limit will be depleted if it is not used in 15 seconds, requiring Cloud to either ""go big or go home"" with the charge in a short amount of time, which could potentially be a huge turnabout on him at the wrong time.","Overall, Cloud has all the tools required to be successful, yet the player must manage these resources to the best of their ability and avoid being thrown off the stage at all times. These abilities also, more often then not, force the player to be vulnerable before they can be used effectively. Even though Cloud has many playstyles applicable to him, the combination of all of the traits above make him a fundamentals-oriented character most of the time, much like Ike, Lucina and Palutena."
Yoshi,3,8.496,"Yoshi is ranked 14th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the bottom of the A+ tier. This is a significant improvement from his 33rd out of 54 placement in Super Smash Bros. 4, and it's his best placement in the series. Yoshi is gifted with high movement speed all around, especially his air mobility, allowing him to often weave in and out of opposing attacks and microspace effectively, as well as allowing him to have fantastic edgeguarding with his long lasting neutral air and Egg Throw, with his neutral air also being a strong out of shield option. He also has high damage output due to his solid combo game, and he has a fantastic air game, with versatile and powerful aerials, like his down air, which is the most damaging down aerial in the game. In addition, he has among the best endurances in Ultimate, as not only he's heavy, but his Double Jump armor allows him to take potentially fatal attacks, which makes it difficult to KO him. His unique shield also always covers his entire body, protecting him from shield stabbing. Yoshi also has a solid recovery, with Egg Throw giving Yoshi some height whenever it is used, a high double jump, and a directional air dodge thanks to the new mechanic added into Ultimate. Despite these strengths, Yoshi still has several notable flaws, as due to possessing little amount of range, it can cause him to get stuffed out by characters with disjointed hitboxes and struggle against certain zoners. In addition, some of his special moves are also inconsistent, with Egg Roll being considered one of the worst special moves in the entire game, and Egg Lay being rather niche. His double jump armor also has a weakness where if a strong enough move hits Yoshi, it breaks armor and can potentially gimp him when heâ€™s offstage, as his recovery options are limited. Yoshi also struggles to contend with juggling, as he's surprisingly floaty for a heavyweight and most of his aerial attacks are ineffective when he's in disadvantage, as they have a noticeable amount of start-up and/or ending lag, which can also limit his approach options. Overall, Yoshi is considered a strong character in the metagame, particularly in Japan, who considers Yoshi a top 10 character and is home to a slew of top Yoshi players such as Yoshidora and Ron. Although less popular outside of Japan, Yoshi continues to have a positive reception and strong results from players such as Meme.","Yoshi is a heavyweight fighter with above-average mobility, good frame data, and decent KO potential. He sports a unique shield in the form of a Yoshi Egg, which covers his whole body no matter the damage it has taken; thus, it makes Yoshi immune to shield stabbing.","As stated previously, Yoshi sports excellent mobility: he has the 27th fastest walking speed, the 19th fastest dashing speed (with an above-average initial dash as well), the single fastest air speed in the game, and the 14th highest air acceleration. Additionally, Yoshi sports among the highest jumping prowesses in the game; this can especially be owed to his double jump, which is the second-highest in the game, only behind Mewtwo's. Along with this, his double jump possesses a unique form of subtractive knockback armor that is active immediately on frame 1, granting him an excellent combo breaker. However, his traction and gravity are the 23rd and 20th lowest in the game, respectively; further compounding this, his falling and fast-falling speeds are among the bottom 10 in the game (the 7th slowest to be specific). Thus, Yoshi is quite speedy overall, yet at the same time, he's one of the floatiest characters in the game, which is incredibly unorthodox for a heavyweight, arguably more so than any other in the game. Complementing his high mobility, Yoshi's moveset possesses very good utility. Both hits of neutral attack can connect into each other, and the first hit can also be used to jab lock as well as combo into moves such as down special for a kill confirm; forward tilt serves as a reliable combo starter at low-mid percents, due to its moderate base knockback and vertical launch angle; up tilt is an effective combo starter with low knockback growth, and leads to KO confirms at higher percents; and down tilt is his fastest tilt, sporting good range and serving as a reliable tech chasing option. Lastly, his dash attack has a long duration and good range; this, combined with its decent knockback, makes it good for KOing opponents at later percents and punishing rolls or techs. Yoshi's smash attacks are also useful in their own right: forward smash has a powerful sweetspot that out prioritizes its slightly weaker sourspot, allowing it to KO at reasonable percents. It also has decent start-up, can be angled, and grants Yoshi intangibility for its duration; up smash has good horizontal and vertical range, reasonable start-up, and a powerful sweetspot, allowing it to KO at percents as low as 120% provided the sweetspot hits; lastly, down smash is extremely quick in both start-up and ending lag which, coupled with its good range, makes it an adept option for punishing rolling opponents. Although his grounded moveset comes with potent attacks, it is Yoshi's aerial attacks that possess high usefulness and make up his fantastic air game. Neutral aerial is a very fast sex kick with low all-around lag, decent range, and good power, allowing it to either KO at surprisingly early percents, serve as an effective combo breaker, be a tech-chase set-up, and be his primary out of shield option. Forward aerial also possesses high range and reasonable all-around lag, and comes with impressive damage; its tipper hitbox meteor smashes opponents, allowing for offstage KOs to occur as early as 20%. Back aerial boasts high speed and high power, with its first two hits being effective combo starters and its final hit KOing below 130%. Up aerial possesses high vertical range and a hitbox that hits behind the opponent which, in tandem with its impressive damage output and low all-around lag, makes it an effective juggling option. Lastly, down aerial serves as the most damaging aerial in the game; its hits can easily link into each other, with its high vertical knockback allowing it to KO at reasonable percentages near the upper blast zone. His grab game is also relatively decent: his grab release and throws grant invincibility during their animations, pummel is fast and deals average damage, forward and back throws are decent KO options by the ledge, up throw has combo potential into his up air at low percents, and down throw has little ending lag making it his most useful combo throw. Yoshi's special moves are also very effective tools for the character. Egg Lay is a command grab which traps the opponent in an egg for a short amount of time, allowing it to work as a damage racker, and when B-reversed is an effective surprise trapping option. Egg Roll travels decently fast on the ground and deals effective damage when running into an opponent, Yoshi Bomb gives Yoshi an option to escape juggles if the situation allows for it, can go through soft platforms, does high damage in both the ground and air, and the grounded version deals high shield damage. However, his best special move is easily his Egg Throw, his only but incredibly effective projectile. The trajectory of the move can be changed depending on the angle of the joystick, can bounce on the ground, and allows Yoshi to have an option for zoning.","Although Yoshi's strengths allow him to be effective in many instances, he has some noticeable weaknesses; the main problem being that his recovery is very limited. His double jump and air speed make getting back onstage with him more plausible, but his double jump can only be used once and if his opponent has a move that breaks his armor limit, then he'll likely be in a difficult situation for getting back onstage. His other recovery options outside of his double jump are very short-ranged and punishable, with Egg Throw only giving vertical distance upon its first three usages and directional air dodges having high ending lag. His reliance on his double jump to recover also impacts his disadvantage state - unlike most other fighters, who can use their midair jump to escape unfavorable positions when landing, the height it grants Yoshi can simply keep him landing for longer, and if he is knocked offstage after using it, then much of his recovery is limited. Because of this, Yoshi players must be especially careful in juggling scenarios, which can be exploited. His approach can also be very punishable as his moves outside of tilts are noticeably slower, with every one of his aerial attacks outside of his neutral and up aerials having below-average speed, and most of his attacks have short-range that leaves him vulnerable to getting stuffed out by disjointed hitboxes. His grab is also very punishable when missed despite its invincibility and long range, Egg Lay is very limited and has no usage if the opponent is far away, Egg Roll has a very predictable trajectory and is hard for Yoshi to get out of if the attack doesn't work well in his current situation, and Yoshi Bomb is also predictable if used unsafely and has high ending lag when Yoshi hits the ground. Finally, his shield, as useful as it is due to never shrinking when weakened, presents a double-edged sword situation: a weakened shield can still be hit easily, and as such can break more easily than a normal shield.","Overall, Yoshi is still a very reliable character despite his glaring weaknesses. With his fast speed and useful moveset, he is very capable of performing combos, scoring KOs, and playing an effective neutral game. As a result, opinions on Yoshi have remained high throughout the game's competitive lifespan."
Samus,4,8.262,"Samus, alongside her Echo Fighter Dark Samus, is ranked 15th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her in the A tier. This is a drastic improvement over Super Smash Bros. 4, where she was tied with Robin at 36th/37th out of 54, and is her best placement in the series to date. This mainly comes as a result of Samus' dynamic moveset, improved from the previous games. Samus' main strength is her powerful far-range neutral game, combined with a decent close-range game as well. For her archetype, Samus possesses a highly sophisticated variety of attacks, ranging from Charge Shot, one of the most powerful neutral specials in the game, to her quick, short and basic hard-hitting combos. She also carries the undisputed best shield pressure in the game for a zoner. Charge Shot is fast and covers wide distance when fully charged. Not only does it deal heavy shield damage, but when slightly charged, can set up for a combo, and when fully charged, can deliver a KO. Missiles is a projectile that allows her to easily force approaches, as it covers space wide enough to catch opponents in the air or spot-dodging, and it inflicts good shield damage. She provides an excellent air game as well, possessing among the strongest aerial attacks in the game, all of which are useful for combos or easy KOs. On top of that, Samus, for a zoner, has a fairly admirable close-range neutral. Her forward aerial is one of the best anti-aerial attacks in the game, as it covers a lot of distance and also inflicts heavy damage and KOs at fairly high percents. She also possesses the longest tether grab of any character in the game in the form of Grapple Beam, which allows her to easily punish opponents that are quick to approach her on the ground. Should opponents reach Samus up closer, she can quickly punish and reset neutral with Screw Attack, which has very high hitsun and knockback, allowing for an easy out of shield KO option at higher percents. Furthermore, Samus has an excellent recovery, with her slow falling speed, Grapple Beam, the great vertical and horizontal distance of Screw Attack, as well as Bombs providing minor boosts to her recovery and serving as a tool for recovery mixups as well. Finally, Samus boasts amazing survivability, with a very heavy weight and amazing recovery allowing her to survive until higher percents, which could sometimes give her rage for an extended period of time and allow her to eliminate opponents first. However, Samus has weaknesses, the most significant ones being her slow mobility and frame data. Samus has rather poor ground mobility, largely hindering her defensive options, and giving her a harder time against opponents who can catch up to her quickly. Samus' projectiles being the most useful part of her gameplan especially, are burdened with significant startup and endlag. Aside from Charge Shot, which takes time and calculation to land successfully, all of her special attacks, especially Screw Attack, have a high amount of ending lag and often leave Samus vulnerable to a sharp punish. This, combined with her low traction relative to the cast, gives her a rather mediocre out of shield game, and with Grapple Beam coming out at frame 15, it gives opponents enough time to spot dodge and punish Samus accordingly. Samus relies on spacing with her special attacks and out of shield options to succeed against her opponents, but with most of her defensive options being risky, she would have a difficult time handling opponents that avoid her projectiles and defensive options. Therefore, Samus is often forced to refrain from using her special attacks carelessly, despite their amazing strength, and it gives her somewhat difficult match-ups against characters that have better frame data and/or mobility and defense options, such as Mario, Fox, and Bayonetta. Furthermore, the relatively high ending lag on her attacks plagues even her stronger attacks, that being her KO options. Her up-smash, while serving as an effective out of shield punish option, is escapable via SDI, struggles to hit short characters on the ground and has a lot of ending lag, while her forward-smash, while quick, is burdened with a large and weak sourspot at close range that takes precedence over the sweetspot hitbox. Furthermore, Samus has a rather poor ground game, with a forward tilt that loses a lot of power at point-blank range, a slow up-tilt and a down tilt with dangerously high ending lag. Her jab, while often used for mixups, is notorious for its inability to connect consistently. This causes Samus to seriously struggle when the opponent is too close to her. Being tall and surprisingly floaty for her weight is only beneficial to a limited degree, as it also makes her relatively easier to punish when in the air and juggle. Finally, her recovery, while amazing, is rather slow, linear, and predictable, so opponents with an effective offstage game will often give Samus a hard time recovering. Overall, Samus is an effective zoner that can quickly and easily deal massive amounts of damage, shield pressure, and secure stocks, while surviving to very high percents. Samus is also a rather popular character in competitive play, mostly because she has a rather low learning curve, with basic combos and neutral gameplay that is highly effective. From the early until the current metagame, Samus has had consistent growth in successful representation, and has seen strong results from players such as Yaura, Sisqui and quiK.","Samus is a heavyweight unique among others. She is a floaty character with slightly below-average walking and dashing speeds, average air speed, above-average air acceleration, high jumps and slow falling speed. These attributes grant her an easier time chasing aerial opponents and forcing air dodges, yet also cause her to be juggled rather easily. When combined with her few reliable landing options and slow falling speed, opponents will also have more time to punish Samus as she attempts to return to the stage.","Samus' moveset consists of playing defensively, as she uses her projectiles to space, rack up damage from a distance and pressure shields. Charge Shot is her most consistent KOing option out of her special moves when fully charged, due to its speed and power. Missiles is mostly used for spacing, due to both its Homing and Super variants being extremely inefficient at KOing, while Bomb grants Samus various mix-ups and can aid her recovery. However, Missile and Bomb also possess valuable utility in that they can guarantee a shield break when used in conjunction with a sufficiently charged Charge Shot or a sweetspotted back aerial. Lastly, Screw Attack is a very useful out of shield option thanks to itâ€™s very high knockback and hitstun, KOing option near the upper blast line and a viable combo finisher from aerial combo strings. In addition, Samus has a strong air game. The changes to air dodges have benefitted her overall, as they notably improve her ability to edgeguard (especially with moves such as forward aerial or her renowned Charge Shot), while she isn't hindered as much due to her fast air speed, the ability to stall midair using her Bombs, and her Grapple Beam tether recovery's long range. All of Samus' aerials have no more than 20 frames of landing lag, and her back aerial is one of her best moves courtesy of its power, damage output, speed and range. Her down aerial can be a powerful meteor smash, forward aerial is a good pressuring tool due to its long duration, and up aerial is an excellent combo option. Lastly, her neutral aerial is a viable KOing option. When coupled with her high jumps, Samus' air game is also potent while she is off-stage, as she can recover from nearly anywhere on the stage, stay in position for longer periods of time due to her floatiness, or bait the opponent by stalling in the air and punishing edge-guard attempts. Samus' grab game is also useful thanks to a variety of perks. Her Grapple Beam has impressive overall range and is useful in the air as either a tether recovery or a grab aerial, the latter of which is potent for zoning thanks to its aforementioned range and very minimal landing lag. Down throw is very useful for starting combos that deal respectable damage and can be used with her neutral, forward and up aerials at varying percentages. Many of her combos can rack up more than 30% and when using platforms to her advantage, or string together multiple times and then be finished with Screw Attack, leading to a KO or dealing 40%-50% at the very least. Up throw is Samus' strongest throw and, unlike in SSB4, it is capable of KOing quite reliably (especially on platforms), thanks to its redistributed damage output and increased knockback. Although forward throw and back throw have decent damage outputs, their only utility is creating space and setting up edge-guards, and both are mediocre at best in doing so.","However, Samus has noticeable flaws. Samus' ground game is mediocre overall as her smash attacks are punishable, with only her forward smash being a fairly reliable KOing option due to its quick start-up lag. Her neutral attack is very mediocre, which is noticeably exemplified in its inability to connect at high percentages and thus limits Samus' anti-pressuring ability. Due to this and her average dashing speed, most Samus players will often find themselves in the air, where her strengths lie. Samus also has issues with her recovery. Her grab aerial has very long range, her jumps are among the highest in the game, Screw Attack is fast and hard to punish, and Bomb jumping provides infinite horizontal recovery, but they are all offset by Screw Attack's only average distance, Bomb's high ending lag in the air and Samus' only average air speed and reliance on her grab aerial to grab edges from a distance. Altogether, this results in her recovery being slightly slow, linear and predictable.","Overall, Samus is a character that performs best when using her projectiles and grab aerial for spacing in order to set up combos and either finish off pressured opponents off-stage, or KO them outright with Charge Shot. Unlike the majority of veterans, Samus' optimal playstyle is highly unorthodox; as she falls short in regard to zoning-exclusive or melee-exclusive offense, success with Samus requires careful and strategic use of her various tools to keep momentum in her favor. As such, she is a character that is hard to master, but greatly rewards patient and calculated play."
Palutina,4,8.143,"Palutena is ranked 16th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her in the A tier. This is a huge improvement over her 44th out of 54 placement in SSB4. Palutena is one of the most improved veterans from the transition to Smash 4 and Ultimate due to the engine of Ultimate complementing her unique strengths. Her aerials are a core part of her neutral due to her high aerial mobility and their effective traits: they both start and extend combos, most notably with her neutral aerial, which is commonly considered one of the best moves in the game due to its overall utility for starting combos, comboing into itself, high active frames and KOing at very high percents. Her back air is great for retreating and mid-range combat due to the invincibility of the shield and priority, while up air is an amazing disjointed multi-hit that functions as a juggle tool and KO option. Her grab game is also impressive due to its above-average reach and her decent set of throws. Overall, this results in her having one of the best advantage states in the game. Her specials also have seen noteworthy improvements: Autoreticle is useful for interrupting midrange approaches or recoveries, Explosive Flame is effective for general zoning and for halting approaches, Warp makes her difficult to edgeguard consistently, and her Reflect Barrier functions as a simultaneous counterattack and reflector that enhances her already strong defense. Despite these many strengths, Palutena is not without her flaws. Despite her excellent air game, her ground game is below average for a top tier, having slow and unsafe tilts and committal smash attacks. She also has trouble securing stocks at high percents due to her KO moves being fairly predictable (like Explosive Flame) or easily staled due to overuse (back aerial). Palutena's main combo starters are also unsafe on shield and thus forces her to mix up her gameplan and neutral. Finally, her recovery is completely reliant on Warp, which has no active hitbox and can be consistently two frame punished. Overall, Palutena is a simple but effective character at all levels of play, with well-rounded abilities and few overwhelming weaknesses. She has often been considered a top-tier contender since the release of the game, and has been one of the most popular characters in competitive play, with results spearheaded by Nairo in the early metagame and a multitude of other Palutena players since, including Jagaimo, Lui$, and Raflow.","Palutena is a tall middleweight. Her walking speed, dashing speed, air acceleration and gravity are above-average; her air acceleration, in particular, is the 5th highest in the game. Palutena also has relatively high jumps, although her traction and falling speed are both merely average, while her air speed is below-average. Thanks to her attributes, Palutena's overall mobility is excellent, even in spite of her aerial mobility being a bit slower compared to her grounded mobility.","Palutena has a dynamic, well-rounded moveset. She has both excellent combo potential and good zoning tools, which allow her to be effective when fighting offensively or defensively. Her staff counts as a disjointed hitbox and she has two projectiles in her moveset as part of her special moves, meaning she can apply safe pressure from a distance and force approaching opponents off her. Her projectiles are unique by the fact that they are completely unconventional. Her aerial-based moveset, speed and versatility means she can easily overwhelm opponents and quickly rack up damage. Palutena's ground attacks are generally the weakest part of her moveset, but they can be useful. Her neutral attack possesses decent range, whereas her neutral infinite is a reliable damage racking option that can also function as a situational KO option at very high percentages while near the edge. Palutena's dash attack is very fast, grants her partial invincibility, and its clean hitbox enables it to function as a situational KO option at very high percentages. Her tilt attacks are somewhat situational due to their lagginess, but have their own individual perks. Forward tilt has long-lasting hitboxes that enable it to intercept approaches and floor recoveries, while its second hit is strong enough to KO at very high percentages while near the edge. Down tilt is a useful 2 frame punish that semi-spikes grounded opponents and launches aerial opponents vertically, thus enabling Palutena to edgeguard reliably afterward. Lastly, up tilt has the fastest startup among her tilts, it can initiate aerial pressure, and it is even a serviceable KO option at very high percentages. Palutena's grounded offense is further supplemented by her strong grab game: her grabs are quick and have respectable ranges, while each of her throws vary from being decent to useful. Palutena's down throw is a reliable combo starter, since it can combo into each of her aerials, and even has KO confirms at high percentages. Her back throw is her strongest throw, being capable of KOing at around 130% while near the edge. Palutena's forward and up throws are much less useful in comparison, but have their own perks regardless. Forward throw has a KO confirm into Explosive Flame at high percentages, whereas up throw is decent for launching opponents into the air in order to initiate aerial pressure safely. Palutena's smash attacks are very strong KO options thanks to their considerable power and very long ranges. Up smash has a very long-lasting hitbox and covers a lot of vertical range directly in front of Palutena; it can be used to KO opponents in the air and even intercept air dodges due to how long the hitbox lasts. Her forward and down smashes are similar, both in their damage output and the fact that they have a wind effect to move opponents away from Palutena if they are just outside of the moveâ€™s hitbox. The strongest part of Palutena's moveset, however, is her air game. Her aerial attacks are each useful in regard to comboing or KOing; despite each of her aerials having rather high ending lag, they compensate for this by having very low landing lag and generous autocancel windows, making them very safe on shield. Her neutral aerial is a very fast and safe move, being Palutena's best combo tool by far as it combos into her other aerial attacks (including itself) until fairly high percentages, while also having KO potential at very high percentages. Her up aerial is an extremely good juggling tool capable of KOing while near top blast zone at around 100% (even on heavyweights), with its fairly large, long-lasting hitbox making it difficult to avoid. Her back aerial, like her dash attack, grants invincibility on Palutena's shield. It has the strongest knockback of any of her aerials, making it one of Palutena's best KO options, especially when used as a reverse aerial rushed follow up from down throw. Her forward aerial, while not quite as strong, is a good combo finisher that is also useful for edgeguarding, and is even capable of KOing at very high percentages while near the horizontal blast zones. Although down aerial is generally considered to be Palutena's least useful aerial, it is a guaranteed meteor smash against airborne opponents. Additionally, Palutena's special moves each have utility, most prominently for zoning. Explosive Flame, formerly one of her custom moves in Super Smash Bros. 4, is her side special attack and is useful at forcing opponents into the air, as well as for securing KOs while near the upper blast zone at higher percentages. Palutena's neutral special attack, Autoreticle, is not quite as useful as Explosive Flame, yet it is another projectile that can apply long-ranged pressure safely and rack up damage. Her up special move, Warp, is useful for achieving a more favorable stage position; when coupled with its invincibility frames and Palutena's high jumps, Warp is an extremely useful recovery tool. Palutena's down special move, unlike in SSB4, consists of 2 moves: Counter activates against melee attacks, whereas Reflect Barrier activates against reflectable projectiles at either close range or from a distance. Lastly, several of Palutena's moves, such as her tilt attacks and aerial attacks, inflict additional shield damage; as a result, Palutena can pressure opponents consistently and reliably, especially since her forward and back aerials can autocancel with a short hop fast fall.","Despite having considerable strengths, Palutena also has a number of noticeable weaknesses. Her most glaring problem is her mediocre ground game: barring her dash attack, the remainder of her grounded attacks come out on frame 8 or later, and almost all of her moves either have high startup (smash attacks and down tilt), punishable ending lag (forward, back and down aerials and smash attacks), long durations (her tilt attacks), or all three (forward tilt and special moves). Although Palutena's overall frame data is quite faster than it was in SSB4, she can still be rendered very vulnerable if her attacks miss or if the opponent evades and/or blocks them. Although a number of Palutena's moves have the potential to KO at reasonable percentages, she can still struggle to score KOs due to her options being either somewhat risky or situational. Her smash attacks are very punishable due to their significantly high amounts of overall lag to offsetting their impressive power. Explosive Flame and, to a lesser extent, back aerial are also easily punishable if whiffed due to their ending lag. Up aerial relies on Palutena being underneath her opponent. Furthermore, while Palutena's recovery is decent in its distance, Warp leaves her helpless and lacks a hitbox to protect her; when combined with the fact that Palutena is a tall character, her recovery can be exploited easily by opponents who know how to intercept Warp.","Despite this, Palutena is generally considered at worst a high tier character due to her versatility, well-roundedness and relatively easy combo game. Her lack of overwhelming weaknesses means that there are few opponents she struggles against."
Pikachu,4,8.123,"Pikachu is ranked 17th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it in the A tier. This is a notable improvement from its 15th out of 54 placement in SSB4. Pikachu's strengths come from its overall great mobility all around. Its most prominent strengths are in its neutral and edgeguarding game, due to the fast startup, low endlag of all its aerial attacks, and its ability to recover far from the stage thanks to Skull Bash and Quick Attack. All of its aerials also auto-cancel on a short hop, which grants it utility for out of shield punishes and potential zero-to-death combos. Despite its poor range, Pikachu also possesses a strong grab game: its back and forward throws allow it to set up combos leading to edgeguards while its down throw is a valuable combo starter. Pikachu possesses a strong, far-travelling projectile in Thunder Jolt, which is used to help Pikachu's approach and edgeguards. Finally, Pikachu has arguably one of the best disadvantage states in the game due to itâ€™s extremely small hurtbox, frame 2 air dodge, and the aforementioned low startup on itâ€™s aerials, making it very difficult to combo and allowing Pikachu to reset into neutral with relative ease. However, Pikachu has some notable weaknesses. Due to being one of the lightest fighters in the game, its survivability is hindered against characters with strong finishers. Pikachu also struggles to KO effectively due to none of its aerials having the ability to KO onstage, while most of its KO moves are either only effective at high percents or have notable downsides such as sourspots or high ending lag. Lastly, its poor range and lack of disjoints gives it few options to approach aside from Thunder Jolt; its reliance on the projectile provide it with a noticeable disadvantage against characters who can properly deal with it. Overall, Pikachu's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. Even before the release of Ultimate, many players saw Pikachu as a top tier character, and its strengths have been proven by strong performances from players such as ESAM and ShinyMark. However, Pikachu's playerbase is rather small while its overall results are mediocre compared to other top tiers, with both ESAM and ShinyMark seeing high highs but mediocre lows. As such, Pikachu status as a top tier character has been subject to debate, with opinions on the character varying wildly depending on region.","Pikachu is a lightweight with a small hurtbox, tied with Kirby, Olimar, Sephiroth, and Mewtwo for the seventh lightest fighter. It has overall good mobility, possessing fast walking and dashing speeds, high jumps, is tied for the ninth-highest air acceleration, and has the fourth-highest traction, but slightly above average falling speed and gravity and below-average air speed. Due to its fast mobility, a strong projectile in Thunder Jolt, exceptional frame data, and among the fastest defensive options, Pikachu has an exceptional neutral game and rarely struggles to approach.","Pikachu's main strengths are its fast frame data and dominant edgeguarding game, with each being considered among the best of the cast. This is mainly due to Pikachu's aerials, each of which can autocancel in a short hop. Its neutral, forward, back, and up aerials are fast, all of them except for up aerial being multihit attacks that can combo into each other and most of Pikachu's other moves, with their extremely low ending lag making them excellent for combos, edgeguarding, and potential zero-to-deaths. Forward and back aerials in particular are notoriously effective as neutral options due to their animation low-profiling Pikachu's already small hurtbox, which makes them notably hard for most characters to punish out of shield. Up aerial is a fantastic juggling option to boot, while neutral aerial notably converts into both up smash and down smash if used while landing, making it Pikachu's most reliable method of confirming KOs at high percentages. Down aerial can meteor smash in its first two active frames and is fast for a move of its category, with its long-lasting hitbox making it an extremely potent edgeguarding option as well. Down aerial also is its only aerial with over 20 frames of ending lag, though it still has relatively low lag compared to other meteor smashes of its kind. Another notable strength Pikachu has is its ability to escape pressure. It boasts a frame 2 air dodge and an incredibly small hurtbox, which combined with its light weight and fantastic frame data make it among the most difficult characters to combo. The speed and versatility of its up special Quick Attack makes it trivial to land and escape disadvantage compared to the majority of the cast, while its aforementioned frame data gives it one of the strongest out-of-shield games through its neutral aerial, back aerial, and up smash. It additionally boasts a phenomenal recovery, with Quick Attack's long distance and multiple angles (there must be a difference of 30 degrees between each jolt's arc, or the second jolt will not come out) making it exceptionally difficult to edgeguard, and its side special Skull Bash providing additional horizontal distance if necessary despite being risky to use. All in all, Pikachu boasts an incredible disadvantage state that allows him to rapidly and effectively reverse the situation on the opponent if they make a single mistake. Pikachu has a potent grab and throw game despite its poor grab range. It has a fast pummel and its forward and back throws are good for setting up edgeguards, with back throw also being able to KO near the ledge at high percents. Its up throw can combo into down special Thunder and reliably KOs middleweights around 170%. Down throw is a fantastic combo starter, being able to combo into Thunder and all of Pikachu's aerials setting up ""nair loops"" which involves using dragdown nair and up tilt to rack up damage while reacting to the DI of the opponent to continue the combo. It can also lead into various combos and kill confirms depending on the opponent's DI, including up air bridges which can take the opponent all the way offstage before Pikachu KOs them with a forward air. Extending Pikachu's notorious combo game revolves around using its aerial attacks to drag the opponent down, thereby extending the combo further. Thunder Jolt also complements its advantage state nicely as it can combo into any of Pikachu's moveset or be used to pressure the opponent and make them hesitatingly pick options while under pressure.","Pikachu is not without weaknesses, however. All of its normal attacks excluding forward smash have poor range, with most of said attacks being barely disjointed or not at all. Because of its lack of range, Pikachu tends to rely on using Thunder Jolt to help it approach the opponent. It gets KO'd relatively early due to its diminutive weight, and it also bears inconsistent raw KO power itself. Dash attack is powerful but extremely unsafe if whiffed, up throw doesn't KO under 170% without rage, and its forward and up smashes are burdened by several sourspots that make them unwieldy to use. Beyond this, none of its aerials are strong enough to KO reliably while onstage, and its other KO moves (down smash, forward tilt, and back throw) are unfit for KOing until around 150% by the ledge. While Thunder is powerful, it has slow start-up and high ending lag that limits its usage to be a situational combo finisher and edgeguarding option. A notable weakness in Pikachu's otherwise potent neutral is its inability to trade due to many of its aerials being multihits, meaning that if a trade occurs Pikachu will deal about 1% while taking the full damage of the move it trades with, a substantial weakness considering how light the character is.","Overall, Pikachu's strengths outweigh its weaknesses and it is universally considered to be a top-tier character, with many proclaiming it as a top 3 character."
Sora,4,8.087,"Sora is ranked 18th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the A tier. Sora possesses a highly dominant aerial game, characterized by an extremely long-distanced double jump that allows him to chase opponents above him, and a number of aerial attacks that sport great power and hitbox coverage. Most distinct among Sora's combat prowess is his possession of an array of natural combos that, when used in conjunction with his unique double jump, allow Sora to perform extensively damaging combo loops via the instant double jump and SHFF techniques. Sora can initiate these combo loops reliably thanks to a host of great combo starters both in the air and on the ground, and many of them also have routes that lead into KOs. A prevalent trait among all of Sora's attacks is their high amount of active frames, granting him considerable margin of error when timing precise attacks in advantageous situations, and also allows him to tech-chase and cover edge options with relative ease. His special moves grant him a considerable amount of utility; Magic cycles through multiple projectiles that offer him pressure tools in the neutral game, Counterattack allows Sora to interrupt any melee attack, and Aerial Sweep functions as a potent high-rising KO option. He sports an immaculate recovery that complements his flexible off-stage presence, and can mix up his approaches through the use of Sonic Blade. In contrast to the majority of his fellow swordfighters, Sora also possesses a great grab game: each of his grabs are fast, while his down throw and back throw are reliable for starting combos and KOing outright, respectively. However, Sora is not without flaws. His biggest weakness is his range; while swordsmen are typically characterized by sacrificing frame data in favor of having more range, Sora possesses one of the shortest effective ranges for a swordsman in the roster while still maintaining typical swordsman flaws, which makes spacing much harder for him than other characters of his archetype. This is compounded by his suboptimal air speed, floatiness, and slow double jump, making it challenging for him to weave in and out of enemy threat range while throwing out attacks, as well as escaping disadvantage. Sora is also a lightweight, and thus susceptible to being KO'd at early percentages by stronger characters. His special attacks, despite their well-rounded traits, have a few inconvenient quirks that the player has to circumvent; these include Magic needing to cycle through each of its spells instead being able to be used freely (with Thundaga in particular being a weaker move to use in neutral), Counterattack not being able to be B-reversed or detect attacks behind Sora (outside of an incoming hitbox overshooting and thus activating it) and its reflector being situational, and Sonic Blade losing range when it is shielded. Although Sora's early representation was sporadic, he saw a rise in results courtesy of significant placements by top players, such as Kameme, HIKARU and Raarchyor. Overall, Sora is considered a respectable fighter at a competitive level who must exercise care in his defensive play to reap the rewards of his high overall damage output, extensive combo potential, and potent KO potential.","Sora is a swordsman whose mobility attributes reference his movement in the Kingdom Hearts series. Although he is a lightweight that weighs the same as Zelda, his aerial mobility is notable: he has a below-average fall speed, extremely low gravity (on par with Kirby), and a very poor initial jump, yet has a very high and delayed double jump. Sora's air speed is lackluster due to it being the 24th slowest, but he has the 15th highest air acceleration. Comparatively, Sora's grounded mobility is poor: he has the 10th slowest walking speed, the 24th slowest dashing speed, and the 11th lowest traction.","Thanks to his aerial attributes, Sora can stay in the air for a long time to inflict damage but has trouble closing in or escaping ground pressure through his mobility alone. Conversely, Sora has among the longest recoveries in the game thanks to his aforementioned double jump, Sonic Blade (his side special move) granting up to three additional bursts of movement, and Aerial Sweep (his up special move) granting both extra vertical height and the ability to transition into Sonic Blade. Overall, especially compared to his fellow swordfighters, Sora struggles to apply and escape pressure on the ground given his lackluster mobility and laggy attacks, but fares much better in the air, where the combination of his floatiness and his attacks' lingering hitboxes allows him to perform combos and create havoc while staying airborne. The centerpiece of Sora's game plan is his aerial game, in large part due to his aforementioned jumping abilities. Neutral and forward aerials are natural combos, similar to Bayonetta's forward aerial. Holding or repeatedly tapping the attack button for each move completes the full combo, whereas tapping the button once initiates only one hit. However, of note is that the first hit of his forward aerial during a fast fall negates his upward momentum, allowing for KO confirms upon landing well past mid percentages. Back aerial is strong enough to KO reliably, and it even has relatively low landing lag (at 11 frames), which makes it relatively safe on shield. Sora's down aerial, Hurricane Blast, works well as an edge-guarding tool due to its long duration, low ending lag, and Sora's aforementioned double jump. However, where Sora's air game shines is his up aerial: its respectable power enables it to carry opponents closer to the upper blast line or even KO them outright, while its lengthy active frames and decent landing lag (at 10 frames) make it a potent combo tool in the air or when SHFF'd. Sora has several tools that make for a respectable ground game. Neutral attack and forward tilt are similar to his neutral aerial in that they are natural combos that either initiate only one hit on a single button press, or the full combo if the attack button is held or repeatedly tapped. In particular, his neutral attack comes out on frame 5, making it a good tool for close-range pressure, and its high vertical hitbox gives it minor anti air properties. His forward tilt has somewhat slow startup, but compensates with more versatility than his other moves; when tapped once, its first hit has enough power to KO reliably while near the edge despite its fairly unimpressive damage output, and when held or tapped repeatedly, it deals much more damage while sacrificing some of its KO potential. Up tilt functions much like Palutena's equivalent move, as it is a useful anti-air attack that hits multiple times and has overall decent range. Unlike hers, however, Sora's is also useful for setting up combos at low percentages. Down tilt is one of Sora's go-to combo starters, being able to combo into his aerial moves at low to medium percentages. In particular, its combo into up aerial combo can KO quite early if the opponent does not react correctly. Lastly, dash attack's very large area of effect makes it useful as both a burst option and a 2 frame punish. Although situational, its clean hitbox is nevertheless capable of KOing at very high percentages while near the edge. Sora's smash attacks are serviceable in their own right. Forward smash is the least reliable of his smash attacks due to its startup and ending lag leaving him vulnerable, but it is also the most powerful and can even negate other projectiles. Up smash has deceptively good range in front of him, and likewise has strong KO power, being one of the strongest up smashes in the game. Lastly, down smash functions like Ridley, King K. Rool and Incineroar's equivalent moves, as it involves him hopping before striking the ground. In doing so, he can vault over low profiling attacks, but unlike other moves, the move is also well suited for 2 frame punishing, since the move's hitbox goes well below him. While most swordfighters are traditionally burdened with ineffective grab games, Sora's grab game is atypically strong for his archetype. His standing grab is among the fastest in the game with only 7 frames of startup and his throws have good utility. Forward throw is unable to KO at realistic percentages, even near ledges, and thus it is mainly used for launching foes offstage and setting up edge trap situations. Up throw is also decently powerful and can set opponents up for juggles if they do not DI or react correctly but does not KO until over 180% for middleweights. In comparison, Sora's back and down throws are much more useful. Back throw is a useful KO option, thanks to it being able to KO middleweights at around 120% near the edge. Down throw is a useful combo starter due to neutral, forward and up aerials being reliable follow-ups, and it can position opponents for juggles and other aerial situations like up throw. Sora has a useful kit of special moves. His neutral special, Magic, cycles between three attacking spells (Firaga, Thundaga and then Blizzaga), each cycling after the previous one has been utilized. Firaga functions similarly to Breegull Blaster, being able to launch fireballs by repeatedly pressing the attack button, and can confirm into moves like his dash attack. After finishing, Firaga transitions to Thundaga, which drops several bolts of lightning that combo into each other. Notably, the last bolt has very strong KO power, making it the only spell that can outright KO reliably. Lastly, Thundaga transitions to Blizzaga, which sports decent range, does a lot of shield damage, and freezes opponents starting at mid to high percentages, allowing him to deal additional uncontested damage. While not a reliable KO option, Sora is able to convert the attack into a KO if he reads the opponent's escape with one of his attacks sporting a lingering hitbox. Casting each spell in the air stalls Sora's vertical momentum, allowing him to apply offensive pressure offstage, though Thundaga's lag causes him to fall comparatively faster than the other spells. Sora's side special, Sonic Blade, functions similarly to Quick Attack: when it is initiated near an opponent, Sora faces them and performs a dashing thrust; otherwise, he continues to move in the direction the Control Stick is held in. If the special attack button is tapped, Sora dashes forward once, but if directions are continuously inputted, Sora strikes up to three times instead. Pressing the special attack button during the input phase will cause Sora to automatically aim at the nearest opponent. While lacking in KO power, the lock-on version of the attack sports decently strong knockback and can set up an advantage situation if connected. His up special, Aerial Sweep, functions very similarly to Spin Attack, and is a multi-hitting attack with strong KO power and decently fast startup (frame 9), giving Sora a decent out of shield option. A key difference with the aforementioned Spin Attack is that Aerial Sweep propels Sora upward, regardless of whether it is used on the ground or in the air. It can also transition into Sonic Blade if the move input is performed near the jump's apex, which grants Sora a noticeably long-distanced recovery in the process. Sora's down special, Counterattack, works as both a counterattack and a reflector, similarly to Counter / Reflect Barrier, Gut Check, and Tetrakarn / Makarakarn. Uniquely among said moves is that projectiles get reflected behind Sora rather than in front of him. While this makes the move ineffective as a direct reflector, it grants him some defense against characters with both reflectors and projectiles (such as Mario, Mewtwo, and Hero). Unlike other counterattacks in the game, Sora's counterattack interrupts any direct attack of the opponent by putting them in a rebound state, which gives it the ability to prevent even invincible attacks like Wonderwing, however one downside with the counterattack is that it will only register attacks from the front. Although Sora's counter special has fewer active frames and slightly more startup than other swordfighters like Marth, Sora can interrupt the ending lag at frame 52, much quicker than most other counterattacks, making it less punishable. One of Sora's most defining traits across his moveset are the presence of lingering hitboxes. Almost all of Sora's grounded moves and aerials, as well as select specials like Blizzaga, feature an extensive number of active frames, granting Sora a fair degree of safety when it comes to throwing out attacks and intercepting opponents. Many of these attacks also cover a plethora of angles, though these are perhaps most notable in his aerials as a result of Sora's aforementioned ability to negate his upward momentum through fast falling. Because of this, Sora has a deadly juggling game and can keep opponents above him trapped in disadvantage for extended periods of time. When combining the fixed knockback of several of his single hit natural combo strings with the unique traits of his jump, these traits open up potent combo loops through the usage of the instant double jump technique, allowing Sora the ability to cancel his attacks and hit confirm into longer combos, stronger attacks, and even KOs. As a result of these factors, Sora has a number of ways to cover tech chases, air dodges, and multiple committal ground and aerial recovery options when he is pushing advantage, in particular sporting a strong edge trapping game, and in many cases they may be the difference maker between an opponent's survival and them being KO'd.","However, for as many strengths as Sora has, he also has several flaws. His low weight and below-average falling speed make him very susceptible to vertical KOs. Despite his high amount of active attack frames, he has below-average frame data on his moveset, making it hard for him to escape from combos. With all of these factors considered, he is particularly susceptible to wall of pain combos, as he has no realistic ways of defending himself. Sora's range is arguably his biggest weakness. Despite being a swordsman, the Kingdom Key's range is among the shortest of any weapon in Ultimate. This leaves Sora at a disadvantage against other fighters who sport disjointed ranges, such as Shulk and Sephiroth (especially given their respective sword attacks). When combined with his aforementioned frame data, he is unable to keep maximum distance from other characters as effectively as other spacing-oriented characters (such as Marth and Simon) and can result in opponents being able to chase him down more easily. Despite his grabs being quick, they also suffer from abysmal range like many other swordfighters, but to an even larger extent; Sora's standing grab, in particular, is tied with Pikachu's for one of the worst grab ranges among the entire cast. This means Sora needs to rely on a lot of defensive play to convert into his advantage state, spacing aerial attacks and using Magic attacks like Firaga as neutral coverage. His lackluster range and mobility also limit his disadvantage somewhat, forcing him to rely on certain momentum-stalling moves like Magic attacks and down aerial to maneuver his way back into neutral. Lastly, Sora's special moves all have certain unique flaws that force him to maintain a patient playstyle. Magic cannot freely swap between its spells (unlike other multi-weapon attacks, such as Peach's forward smash), forcing him to repeatedly use his spells to cycle through the most optimal one for a given situation. Transitioning also leaves Sora vulnerable since he cannot move on the ground until his current spell concludes, making him whiff punishable unless the player mitigates it through aerial usage. Since all three spells are projectiles they can also be reflected, though this is suboptimal against Thundaga. Sonic Blade slows down slightly upon hitting a shield (although given the short amount of time it takes to transition between hits, punishing the move can prove to be difficult), while Sora cannot input any actions if the move concludes in the air, making him very vulnerable. Aerial Sweep does not hit behind Sora on startup, and Sora is vulnerable to meteor smashes since the move does not hit directly above him. Counterattack's aforementioned ineffectiveness against projectiles makes it infeasible for reflected projectiles to KO opponents. Like Scintilla and Gut Check, it also leaves the area directly behind Sora unprotected.","Overall, Sora's playstyle is reminiscent of Jigglypuff where his light weight and somewhat lackluster direct range force him to play very patiently in order to get the most out of his combos and strong air game. His ability to reliably edge-guard the majority of the cast alongside his wide array of combo routes give him the potential to KO at very early percentages. However, he must be very careful to not overextend or whiff too much as he has the potential to be KO'd at very early percentages."
Roy,4,8.077,"Roy is ranked 19th out of 82 on the tier list, placing him in the A tier. This is a significant improvement from his mid-tier placement in SSB4, where he was ranked 41st out of 54 characters, and his best placement in the series. Roy's primary strength revolve his fast air and dash speeds which, combined with great frame data in his aerial and tilt attacks, gives him a strong combo game and several mix-up options. The mechanic changes in Ultimate also benefit Roy by making it easier for him to approach and land his sweetspot at the hilt, which in turn makes it easier for him to not only rack up damage quickly, but also take stocks at relatively early percentages. Roy possesses some strong KO options with quick start-up such as forward tilt, forward smash and Double-Edge Dance. However, Roy also has several weaknesses, the most significant being his weak recovery, with a fast falling speed and Blazer giving him poor vertical distance. This leaves him susceptible to gimps and edgeguarding at early percents. Roy's fast falling speed also give him a poor disadvantage state, in which he is easier to combo and juggle than other characters. Finally, Roy's blade is afflicted by a weak sourspot at the tipper, which hinders his combo, spacing game, and overall range. Therefore, he has to get close to his opponent at every time to be able to land the sweetspot. Overall, Roy is considered to be one of the best swordfighters in the game, and this has been reflected by his above-average representation in the metagame, which is spearheaded by players such as Kola, Goblin, and HIKARU.","Roy is a middleweight swordsman, although his main attributes deviate heavily from other fellow middleweights. He boasts very fast dashing, air, and falling speeds, but has an only slightly above-average walking speed, as well as fairly low air acceleration and jumps. Roy has an attribute unique to him that other swordfighters do not have: his inverse tipper. Contrary to Marth specifically, his Binding Blade does the most damage if attacking near the sword's hilt, although it does weak damage and knockback when otherwise tippered. While this gives Roy effectively bigger sweetspots than those who rely on a tipper to deal maximum damage, it weakens his spacing abilities despite being a swordfighter.","Roy's greatest strength is his KO potential, which is very high when compared to other middleweights, and can even be comparable to the power of some of the harder-hitting heavyweights on the roster, such as Bowser and Incineroar. In conjunction with his overall fast frame data for a swordfighter, he can inflict large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. Neutral attack can catch aggressive approaches due to its speed and deceptively large hitbox, and can efficiently set up into his more powerful normal attacks. His forward tilt, up tilt, and forward smash are all very fast startup-wise, with each being among the strongest attacks of their kind; notably, forward smash can KO under 50% with rage near the edge, even if uncharged. His up smash is an effective anti-air attack due to its quick startup, along with his sword arm gaining intangibility throughout its rather long duration. Roy's KO potential also extends to his great air game, with quick, powerful and damaging aerials; his neutral aerial is a useful combo starter, especially when using the first hit by itself on landing, which allows him to add extra damage to his combos and even open up KO setups at high percentages. His forward aerial autocancels in a short hop and is overall very quick, allowing him to even perform a wall of pain. At high percentages, it also boasts KO potential. Back aerial has the rare and deceptive quality of turning Roy around, as well as being rather quick despite its power, KOing at around 130% from center-stage. Up aerial is Roy's fastest aerial startup-wise, and is a reliable juggling move due to its large hitbox and average knockback, and can even KO by itself at high percentages. Lastly, down aerial is a strong meteor smash when sweetspotted and boasts decent KO potential when sweetspotted on-stage. Roy is also extremely effective at shield pressure and mix-ups. Many of his aerials and his down tilt are safe on shield against shield grabs, allowing him to pressure the opponent's shield until they choose an option to escape, which Roy can then punish. Roy's neutral attack is useful thanks to its KO confirms into his forward, back and up aerials, as well as its ability to pressure shields and to catch the enemy coming out of shield. Roy's neutral aerial is also very effective as a cross-up attack on characters who lack out of shield options that hit behind them. Up aerial can also function as a combo starter and is safe on shield, and leads into different follow-ups dependent on whether the sweetspot or the sourspot connects. Roy can also simply grab opponents for shielding against him; he has simple but efficient throw combos such as down throw into neutral aerial or up aerial depending on percent. Roy even possesses some shield break set-ups if the opponent is not careful, rewarding Roy with a Flare Blade punish. Roy's special moveset maintains his sheer speed and KO power; Flare Blade is known for being one of the strongest single-hitting attacks in the game, with the capability to one-hit KO any fighter in the game when fully charged. Combined with its ability to be reversed and its extremely high knockback, it adds up to be a very potent edge-guarding and ledge trapping tool, and has deceptively low ending lag despite its power to avoid punishment. As a result, Roy is one of few characters who can reliably close out stocks on any shield breaks regardless of the opponents damage. Double-Edge Dance is a quick and efficient damage-racking series of high-speed sword slashes, along with being a reliable finisher at higher percentages if sweetspotted; it is fast enough for each hit to connect reliably and catch spot dodges. His main recovery move, Blazer, is an excellent out of shield option, due to gaining super armor on startup and having decent knockback growth when grounded. Lastly, his Counter has a short window of active frames compared to other counterattacks, but it makes up for being one of the strongest counters in the game thanks to its 1.35Ã— damage multiplier.","Despite Roy's numerous strengths, he has noticeable weaknesses. His biggest flaw stems from his own inverse tipper attribute; by relying on close-quarters attacks to deal damage, it gives him below-average effective reach compared to other swordfighters due to the Binding Blade's tip dealing weak knockback and damage. Thus, Roy cannot rely on a spacing playstyle in spite of his status as a swordsman, since his sourspotted attacks are less reliable as combo starters. This forces him to get dangerously close to the opponent in order for his attacks to properly start combos and deal more damage. This is further worsened by many of his attacks having high ending lag, which makes Roy very punishable if his attacks are simply thrown out without caution. In all, he cannot perform optimally when spacing with the tip of his sword, but cannot afford to make mistakes when at close range without running the risk of massive punishment. Lastly, Roy's offstage endurance is very poor. His fast falling speed makes him fairly susceptible to combos, and as none of his moves are generally reliable enough to consistently break combos, many characters with reliable combo moves can rack up large amounts of damage and easily force him off-stage. To add to this issue, Roy's only recovery move, Blazer, is fairly ineffective despite his impressive mobility: although it offers good protection, can be angled, and covers a decent amount of horizontal distance, it covers little vertical distance, does not sweetspot edges until the latter half of its duration, lacks the grounded version's super armor, and is predictable, leaving him prone to gimping, especially against characters with a reliable gimping projectile or counter. When coupled with his fast falling speed, he is highly susceptible to meteor smashes, and even a sufficiently strong semi-spike can launch him too far away to recover. Multi-hit moves that trade with Blazer's hitboxes can also semi spike Roy and gimp him. This causes him to have one of the worst recoveries in the game and arguably across the whole series.","Overall, Roy is an unconventional swordsman who falls under the bait-and-punish and rushdown archetypes. The objective of his playstyle is to overwhelm his enemy by closing the distance between them quickly, then to deal large amounts of damage with fast attacks without leaving Roy himself open to punishment while remaining in close-range."
Wario,4,8.031,"Wario is currently ranked 20th out of 82 characters on the current Ultimate tier list, being in the A tier; a massive improvement from his tier placement in Smash 4 where he was ranked 40th out of 54 in the E tier, and is his best placement in the series. Wario's greatest strength is his aerial game: he has one of the fastest air acceleration and air speed in the game which, coupled with a set of strong and versatile aerials, allows him to dominate in the air. In addition, his strong aerial movement and short stature makes it harder for opponents to hit him, while his heavyweight status and passive healing through Chomp allows him to live longer compared to the rest of the cast. Finally, Wario is also notorious for his combo potential, which can not only rack up damage quickly but also set up into a KO confirm, most notably Wario Waft. As such, Wario has some of the best comeback potential in the game. Despite these strengths, Wario has several weaknesses that hold him back. The most notable weakness is his poor neutral game: his relatively short range and lack of projectiles make him vulnerable towards characters that can overwhelm, juggle, or outrange him. In addition, Wario's best KO options all have their drawbacks: his forward tilt, back air, and all his smash attacks have either high end lag or slow startup while dash attack has noticeable sourspots. Finally, whiffing Waft means Wario loses his best comeback factor, as it can take a bit to even get to half-Waft. Overall, Wario's strengths largely overshadow his weaknesses. Although very popular in the early metagame, subsequent nerfs via patch updates shrank his playerbase at a top level. However, he remained a viable character with decent representation, in particular amassing consistently high results from Glutonny, Europeâ€™s best and one of the best Ultimate players in the world.","Wario is a short heavyweight character with a great air game and surprisingly fantastic movement in the air. He boasts the 8th fastest air speed in the game, in addition to being tied for the 2nd best air acceleration. Wario also sports an above average falling speed and the 26th highest gravity, which alongside the previous attributes gives him an amazing aerial prowess despite having low jumps. However, his grounded mobility pales in comparison, as his dashing speed and traction are average at best, and his walking speed is the 12th slowest in the game. Using his high mobility and versatile aerial attacks, Wario is able to dip in and out of the fray to bait attacks and punish. Wario's attacks in general also tend to be disjointed, as his hands don't have a hurtbox. He's also fairly hard to hit since he's relatively nimble and short for a heavy character, though fairly wide, meaning he can still be vulnerable to combos and juggles.","Furthermore, Wario boasts strong aerials, with his down, and back aerials being potent kill moves, while the up aerial is a highly damaging juggling and combo extension tool, with limited killing ability as well. Thanks to Ultimate's universal 3-frame jumpsquat, he can finally utilize his forward and neutral aerials as fast moves that can combo and pressure his opponents. Wario's air control and quick aerials also make him very effective at edgeguarding. Wario's ground game contrasts with his air game in that it focuses more on power than speed. His forward tilt and forward smash are among the strongest in the cast, although both are rather slow, and the latter is best suited for hard reads. His up and down tilts are great combo tools that could potentially lead into kill moves, and his new shoulder tackle dash attack is both extremely fast in terms of startup and one of the strongest dash attacks in the game. Wario's grabs are not particularly fast but have above average range. His throws have their fair share utility, with his up throw being able to combo into his up aerial and his down throw being both quite damaging and great for keeping opponents close to pressure them further. Forward throw deals decent damage, and back throw having a strong collateral hitbox that is good at knocking away other combatants. Wario's special moves are also very unorthodox, and they demand practice to be usable at their highest potentials. Chomp is one of the best command grabs in the game, having deceptively long range and decent startup. It heals Wario if it connects, can effectively cover certain edge recoveries and even kill at high percents, negate certain attacks such as Wonderwing, and absorb many projectiles, often with the benefit of further healing him and slightly increasing the charge of his Wario Waft. His Waft is his most significant move because, with time, it is a highly damaging kill move with an extremely fast startup. With Waft in his arsenal, any match can be turned around with the right read. Wario Bike gives Wario an unorthodox approach option that covers for his fairly slow ground movement, and the bike itself continues to move forward and hit opposing fighters even after Wario dismounts it. This gives him a large pseudo-projectile which can apply pressure when used effectively, but the bike has a respawn time which prevents this from being used as a normal projectile. It can be used to surprise unsuspecting players as an approach tool that can blow past some projectiles, dismounted and thrown like an item with kill power, a very effective recovery tool, and a way for Wario to heal and charge his Waft when he eats it. On the flip side, Wario cannot shield or dodge while on the bike and is vulnerable, opponents can throw it right back at him, and if it's destroyed, he has to wait six seconds before using it again, which can leave him helpless while recovering as his up special, the Corkscrew is rather lackluster as a recovery on its own (although it is a decent out-of-shield option as it is his fastest recovery move).","For all of his strengths, Wario does have several weaknesses to counterbalance them. His range is rather mediocre, especially in moves such as neutral aerial and forward aerial, and he lacks projectile attacks outside of a dismounted Wario Bike and thus must take a risk to deal damage. While his bike recovery can go a far distance, it is fairly easy to gimp him when he uses it, so Wario players have to be careful with when and how it is used. While Wario does have some fast moves, he is certainly slower and heavier on average than most characters that share his weaknesses, so he can sometimes be overwhelmed in the neutral against small characters with better range than him. Wario will have to use his overall high mobility to bait his opponents into making mistakes and capitalize on them with his highly damaging combos and powerful kill moves. Despite having a variety of KO moves, Wario can have a difficult time landing them. Firstly, he is burdened with a rather poor set of smash attacks. All three have extremely high ending lag and are very unsafe on shield making them easily punishable while only having average or slightly above average power. Forward smash is very strong but suffers from slow startup and very high ending lag with deceptively short range, up smash has decent startup and grants Wario head intangibility, but has massive ending lag to the point where Wario will be standing at the end of the animation of the move and still be in lag. Finally, down smash has fast startup coming out on frame 8, but has extreme ending lag and very mediocre power which makes it one of Wario's least useful moves. His other KO moves such as his Back aerial, forward tilt and Dash attack also suffer from being sluggish or predictable on top of lacking legitimate kill throws as his forward throw has had its knockback reduced from its previous iteration. This means Wario can often be reliant on Wario Waft for an easier, early KO and is left with a more difficult process of finishing off opponents should it miss.","All in all, Wario is a quite mobile and versatile heavyweight brawler that rewards patient players who know how to use his movement and signature Waft to their fullest potentials. His damage-racking ability and kill power also rewards players heavily for finding creative ways to get around his rather poor range and lack of a proper projectile, and his versatile options and movement give players just the tools to do it."
Wolf,4,7.856,"Wolf is ranked 21st out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the A tier. This is a moderate improvement over his 14th out of 38 placement in Brawl. Wolf is an all-around fighter with many different playstyles to choose from. He has a solid fundamental combo game with up throw and down throw as good combo starters. His moveset offers a lot of versatility, with his tilts functioning as safe pokes or kill options and his smash attacks as solid finishers. His aerials are all useful for both starting and extending combos, as well as edgeguarding. His back aerial, in particular, is one of the strongest in the game when sweetspotted and can be confirmed from a forward aerial. His specials are also crucial to his gameplan: his Blaster is a strong projectile that can force approaches and apply chip damage from a distance, acting as his primary tool in neutral, Wolf Flash and Fire Wolf offer quick recovery to the stage and serve as powerful finishers, and his Reflector is effective for extending combos as well as serving as his primary defense against zoning. Wolf also has excellent air mobility, allowing him to chase his opponents in the air with ease. Despite all these strengths, Wolf has some weaknesses. Wolf is a fast-faller middleweight, which makes him fairly easy to combo despite having a frame 2 air dodge. His recovery is also fairly linear and easy to intercept as it gets 2 framed fairly easily or loses to counterattacks which can leave vulnerable to gimps and edgeguards. While Wolf has good range in many of his attacks, he can have trouble against characters who have longer disjoints than him, such as Roy, Chrom, and R.O.B. Finally, Wolf can sometimes struggle taking stocks at higher percents, as his most potent finishers, including up smash and back aerial, are burdened with excessive startup lag. Overall, Wolf has a solid fundamental gameplan for players to pick up. He functions like a glass cannon, being able to dish out damage with a strong neutral and advantage while having poor offstage survivability, struggling taking stocks from time to time, and being easy to juggle. Wolf has attained a lot of representation across the board through Ultimate's lifespan. He was among the most-played characters in the early metagame, with Zackray representing him greatly in the early metagame while several top players had a pocket or co-main Wolf. Despite a fair decline in the post-pandemic metagame, he is still relatively popular, piloted by loyal Wolf mains such as Atelier, Jakal, and Ouch!?.","Wolf's attributes and moveset give him a versatile gameplan, somewhere in the middle ground between Fox's focus on pressure and Falco's focus on punishes. This is reflected in his attributes: he has a slow dashing speed (though his initial dash is quite fast), an above-average walking speed, the 11th fastest falling speed, above-average air acceleration, and high gravity, most of which are not uncharacteristic of the Star Fox characters. Unlike the other ""space animals"", however, Wolf has the 6th fastest air speed in the game. This grants him mobility that is fairly average overall, but relatively balanced compared to Fox and Falco. Additionally, Wolf is also significantly heavier than them, as he is a middleweight (tied with the Ice Climbers, Lucario, Villager, Mythra, and Steve). Although Wolf's special moveset and vertical mobility are derived from his fellow Star Fox fighters, the similarities end there, with Wolf's being the most unique of the trio.","Wolf's Blaster is the centerpiece of his neutral game. With the lasers causing higher knockback (and therefore hitstun) than the average projectile, and having a long duration with transcendent priority, they grant him the ability to disrupt opponents' approaches, even when their grounded mobility is superior to his own, and its unique close-range hitbox on the bayonet give it some utility in close combat, dealing substantial damage if it connects. Lasers can often force opponents to jump over them, leaving them vulnerable to Wolf's fast aerial attacks; these are comprised of a neutral aerial sex kick with a powerful clean hit, a disjointed forward aerial that can combo into itself and his other aerials, a back aerial with moderate startup offset by its impressive power and hitboxes, an up aerial with fast startup and a wide arc well-suited to juggling, and a down aerial that consistently meteor smashes opponents. Wolf also possesses large hitboxes on several of his attacks with many of them being disjointed, greatly aiding his devastating punish game as he can easily combo and deal massive damage from very few openings. While he can apply pressure from a distance, Wolf's close range options are not lacking either. Forward tilt and down tilt are decent poking tools, the latter of which can trip at low percents, while up smash deals high damage, covers a wide area around him, and has decent knockback. His neutral and forward aerials are quite fast and difficult to punish even if shielded, while his standing grab is tied for the fastest in the game. Further augmenting his strong neutral game are his dash attack and Reflector, the former which is useful for punishing aerial approaches and KOing at high percents, and the latter which allows him to deal with opposing camping while also having a close range hit that can be followed up with aerials. Once Wolf has won the neutral exchange, he has several options to rack up damage. Forward aerial can combo into itself, other aerials and into a grab at very low percents, from which up throw can lead into another forward or up aerial until mid to high percents. Down throw can lead into a dash attack at low percents, while dash attack can extend the combo by chaining into up tilt or up aerial at very low percents. Should an opponent air dodge in an attempt to escape pressure, Wolf's aerial mobility allows him to chase them down and punish them, usually with up tilt or up aerial to continue juggling them, or with a back aerial to send them offstage. After Wolf has inflicted a sufficient amount of damage, he can then attempt to score a KO via his numerous KO options. The most reliable one is his back aerial: its quick autocancel and decent range allow it to be spaced safely, and it can KO relatively early if sweetspotted (at around 110% from center-stage), while still possessing respectable power with its sourspots. His side special, Wolf Flash, can either meteor smash or semi-spike opponents at the end of the dash depending on which hitbox connects, both of which are incredibly powerful. Wolf's up special, Fire Wolf, consists of looping hits and a deceptively strong final hitbox. Other notable finishers are his forward smash and down smash: the former is safe on shield and potentially when whiffed thanks to it possessing deceptively low ending lag in spite of its high startup, whereas the latter posseses a powerful sweetspot that enables it to KO as low as 50% at the edge and makes it an effective 2 frame punish. At higher percents, Wolf has several other moves (forward tilt, sweetspotted up tilt, dash attack, clean neutral aerial, up smash, and back throw) that each sport respectable KO potential in the event he is unable to land his primary KO options.","However, Wolf does possess noticeable weaknesses, the most notable of which is his recovery. Wolf Flash and Fire Wolf are both linear and offer unremarkable travel distance compared to other recovery options. Unlike Fox and Falco, Wolf's side special renders him helpless; this essentially restricts him to using only one of his specials as a recovery option, which leaves him with a much shorter recovery distance overall. This also leaves Wolf highly vulnerable to gimps and edgeguarding, with meteor smashes in particular being deadly against him even at low percents, to the point where exploiting his recovery offsets the increased horizontal endurance his higher weight would otherwise provide. Though he is not short of finishers, Wolf can frequently have difficulty landing his most powerful ones due to their slow startup (with back aerial and all his smash attacks having more than 12 frames of startup), his below-average dashing speed, and his lack of guaranteed setups into them. Although he possesses true setups into Wolf Flash, such as from his forward aerial or down throw at medium percents, they are very risky to pull off, as he can either end up offstage after its use and thus inadvertently self-destruct (since it renders him helpless) or miss the sweetspots and end up vulnerable due to its high landing lag. Lastly, Wolf is, like Fox and Falco, very susceptible to combos because of his high falling speed and gravity. However, Wolf's heavier weight and lack of sufficiently fast options to escape pressure (his fastest aerial attacks start on frame 7) make this weakness even more apparent compared to Fox and Falco.","Overall, Wolf is a non-traditional glass cannon. He sacrifices the power of other glass cannons like Mewtwo and Mr. Game & Watch for sheer versatility, due to his combination of an effective projectile for disrupting and forcing approaches, fast approach options of his own, and an abundance of combo and KO options, which allow him to keep up the pressure on his opponent even after winning the neutral game. As such, Wolf is able to adapt to nearly any playstyle. However, due to his vulnerability to combos, poor recovery, and trouble securing KOs, Wolf must also be well aware of his opponents, as a single mistake can cause him to sustain heavy damage from combos and end up in a position where he in turn can easily be KO'd."
Mario,4,7.844,"Mario is currently ranked 22nd out of 82 characters on the tier list, being in the A tier. This is a slight drop from his 9th out of 54 ranking in Smash 4 where he stood at the lower end of top tier, despite not facing many changes during the transition. Much like his previous incarnation, Mario's greatest asset is his fast frame data; most of his moves have little startup lag and have relatively low end lag. This results in Mario being fairly difficult to punish relative to most of the cast. His combo game is quite flexible, as Mario can rack up damage quickly and reliably with a myriad of options to do so. In particular, his up aerial is one of the best juggling tools in the game, as the move can very easily chain into itself and can lead to near inescapable kill setups either on the top blast line or near the ledge. In addition, he also has a versatile moveset: a disruptive projectile in his Fireball, a reflection-based and reverse-based move in his Cape that can counteract camping, and a decent, if niche edgeguarding option with F.L.U.D.D. However, Mario also has some notable weaknesses. His moves have short range, with his hitboxes being relatively small and stubby when compared to the rest of the cast. This causes him to have difficulty against characters with long or disjointed range. Mario also suffers from a lack of consistent KO setups, due to having predictable, low range, and unsafe kill options at high percents, alongside his short frame and relative floatiness for a middleweight. He also struggles at KOing opponents in general, as he lacks any reliable finishers outside of his smash attacks: while his back throw is slow and vulnerable to DI and other moves like back aerial, down aerial and Super Jump Punch tend to be dependent on edgeguarding or being near the top of the blast line to KO. Marioâ€™s recovery, while good, is still predictable due to Super Jump Punch only travelling a mere average distance. Lastly, Mario's average attributes do not allow him to quickly gain an advantage either, as the strengths of other characters can contest his, with the most notable being his overall range. Overall, Mario's strengths outweigh his weaknesses, and he has seen strong results in competitive play thanks to the efforts of players such as Dark Wizzy, Kurama, and Snow.","Mario is a short middleweight with relatively balanced attributes, possessing slightly above average walking speed, air acceleration, dashing speed and weight, whereas his falling speed and gravity are below average relative to the cast. He also has a very fast air speed (tied with Sonic, Donkey Kong, Little Mac and Inkling for the 12th fastest in the game) and excellent jumps, in exchange for poor attack range and moderately low traction. These balanced stats don't give Mario the edge when it comes to overall movement, but they nevertheless make him adept at most situations where a key attribute is needed to gain the advantage, which when combined with his very quick frame data, grants him a great neutral game. As a result, despite his attributes implying a jack-of-all-trades type of character, Mario is somewhat more of a rushdown character in practice.","Thanks to his incredibly quick attack speed, Mario shines in close-quarters combat. His fast attack speed allows him to consistently apply pressure to the opponent, and he is capable of quickly racking up damage once he gets the momentum, which is easy to do so on characters that cannot match his attack speed without getting heavily punished for it. Excluding his forward smash, forward aerial, and special moves, all of Mario's moves have fast startup and low ending and landing lag (the latter in the case of his aerial attacks, except for his aforementioned forward aerial). All of his grounded moves are prime examples of his quick frame data: his neutral attack is his fastest move and an overall effective way to rack up damage, along with handy combo capabilities, while his up and down tilts are effective combo starters that can help rack up plenty of damage, and the former chains into itself at low percentages. All of his smash attacks are decent KO options, as they can reliably KO at high percentages and have low ending lag; his forward smash has a powerful sweetspot located on the fiery explosion that he emits from his palm and possesses the highest power of all of his smash attacks, down smash is a semi-spike, making it useful for forcing opponents offstage, and up smash is very hard to punish due to its speed, power and slight disjoint due to the intangibility it grants on his head. Mario's aerial attacks are also very useful in many cases. Neutral aerial is a sex kick that can be useful in edgeguarding or for breaking combos. Back aerial has the longest reach and the highest knockback of Mario's aerial moves, allowing it to space effectively and reliably KO offstage. Up aerial's extremely quick startup, vertical launch angle and lack of sourspots let it combo into itself or other moves, on top of letting it easily break or set up combos. Mario Tornado, which is Mario's down aerial, is a great anti-juggling move that also has respectable power, especially if used near the upper blast line. Finally, his forward aerial is a meteor smash with high base knockback for one, making it great for gimping all but the farthest-reaching of recoveries and being an extremely effective KO option offstage. His special moveset is highly varied and has plenty of uses. Fireball is a projectile with a decently long range. It can be useful in the neutral game or in edgeguarding, thanks to its disruptive knockback and downward trajectory, and is very useful for disrupting direct approaches. Super Jump Punch travels in a controllable diagonal direction and grants moderate distance, making it good at recovery. It also has intangibility upon startup, allowing it to be used out of shield very effectively. Due to its extremely quick startup, it is also a useful combo finisher, especially near the blast line. Cape reverses opponents, with the induced disorientation often being enough to allow a free hit or efficiently gimp a recovery, which aids in edgeguarding opponents. It is also a powerful reflector, making it highly useful in matchups against projectile-heavy characters, such as Simon or Samus. F.L.U.D.D. is a mechanism that shoots water, pushing opponents away, which compliments his Cape. Though situational, it can occasionally be used to give Mario some breathing space. As a result of his Cape, F.L.U.D.D. and his fast aerials, Mario also boasts a versatile edgeguarding game. Another valuable strength of Mario is his grab game. Though his grab reach is somewhat average, his dash and pivot grabs extend far past his hurtboxes, granting them unusually disjointed range for a character of his archetype. In addition, his grabs are tied for the fastest in the game, and his pummel is fairly quick. His forward throw sends the opponent at a disadvantageous position, where Mario can capitalize on their mistakes. His up throw is a useful combo starter at lower percentages, comboing into his up, down, and back aerials. His back throw is by far his strongest throw and one of the strongest of its type in the game as well, as it can reliably KO at around 160% near the ledge on any character, and even earlier with rage, being capable of killing as early as 107% with it. Finally, his down throw is a great combo starter that can lead a vast amount of combo opportunities, most notably his up, back, and forward aerials. Finally, and due to the favorable angles his moves send at, his tremendously quick frame data and his extensive amount of combo starters, Mario's combo ability is fantastic, and it is also worth noting that several of Mario's moves can lock, including his neutral attack. This makes it almost always imperative for Mario's opponent to tech all attacks at low to mid percentages when needed; otherwise, Mario can capitalize on the opportunity, and tack on unavoidable massive damage in the process.","Despite Mario's numerous strengths, he is not flawless. His attributes, while well-rounded, are not exactly exceptional, as many characters outclass him in various ways. Notable examples of this include Pikachu having a more versatile edgeguarding game, Luigi and Kazuya having better combo potential, Steve having a superior camping game, Sonic having substantially faster mobility, Bowser having significantly stronger attacks, Snake and Sora having a much more effective recovery, and Shulk and Min Min having drastically larger reach. In particular, the last one is his main weakness: his attacks generally possess relatively poor range. His lack of reach (which was further worsened by the changes to his up-tilt and dash grab) prevents him from fighting at a safe distance, and consistently forces Mario to approach characters on his own. This leads to him having great difficulty against characters with large or disjointed range, particularly weapon users like Lucina and Cloud. While back air is Mario's most effective spacing tool, it too suffers from a mediocre range that limits its utility against disjointed attacks, and fireball, while an overall solid projectile, is slow and lacks transcendent priority, which means it can easily be beaten by any attack with a large hitbox, making it mostly an unreliable tool for camping. While Mario's pressuring capabilities are formidable, his susceptibility to getting spaced out is among the worst in the game due to his moves possessing very stubby and small-sized hitboxes, this results in Mario having a lot of difficulty in approaching and getting his combo game started if his opponents space him properly, as even a character with a slightly disproportionate disjoint can severely limit his ability to get in. In such cases, he will often be forced to rely on reads and make good for what he has when he gets an opening. Another notable weakness is that Mario can also have some difficulty scoring KOs, as he has few strong and reliable finishers and can have difficulty landing them, especially at high percents, which are further compounded by his short range, which limits his options. Outside of his forward and up smashes, none of his other KO moves are very reliable and consistently effective for doing what they're supposed to: his down smash can only KO reliably with its back hit and is unsafe on shield, Super Jump Punch can only KO at very high percentages or close to the blast zones, his back aerial has short range and is unsafe against disjoints, his down aerial has even shorter range and can sometimes have trouble connecting, his back throw is very slow and very susceptible to DI, and his forward aerial is slow and must be sweetspotted (mid hit) in order to meteor smash, while the early hit and late hit (first and last active frame, respectively) have too much ending lag to be used as a combo extender while still being unreliable for killing due to their rather low knockback. Because of this, Mario tends to rely too much on his forward and up smashes or reads to score a KO, and his inconsistent KO potential is further worsened by the changes to rage, which hinders him more than other characters, as it doesn't increase knockback as much as in SSB4. Since it also no longer affects set knockback, he can't use his Super Jump Punchâ€™s connecting hits as a KO confirm at low percents anymore if he has high rage, similarly to Samus's Screw Attack and Peach Parasol. Because of this, he must keep his forward and up smashes fresh and be careful to not get predictable especially with the existence of stale-move negation. While his forward and up smashes are considered among the best of their type, they have their flaws too: the former has noticeable endlag and a sourspot located on Mario's arm, which, while very difficult to hit with, outprioritizes the sweetspot and has rather mediocre power, while the latter has poor range in front of him, to the point where it will sometimes miss completely against short or crouching characters. Lastly, despite being known for his jumping ability (hence his original nickname, Jumpman), Mario's recovery is easy to gimp and is quite predictable. Despite his fast air speed and high double jump, Super Jump Punch, while fast and relatively safe, travels a merely average amount of distance altogether. This means that if Mario is knocked off stage without his double jump, he is extremely vulnerable to edgeguarding, and one hit could be all it takes to kill him. This also leaves Mario very vulnerable to semi-spikes, as they will likely launch him too far to recover at high percentages. Aside from Super Jump Punch, Mario has no other recovery options aside from utilizing Cape's momentum stalling as a mix-up. Nevertheless, Super Jump Punch still offers a serviceable amount of recovery ability and can get the job done, should it be used properly.","Overall, Mario has many clear strengths and very few exploitable glaring weaknesses, resulting in said strengths outweighing said weaknesses. All in all, his above average mobility and largely reliable combo ability allows him to get the edge easily against most characters, as it is hard to escape from his wrath once he gets the advantage, while it is also easy for him to escape from his opponentsâ€™ wrath and regain the advantage. However, because of his low range, Mario must almost always fight in close quarters, and he often relies on reads to secure KOs. Mario has to be very careful off-stage as well in spite of his respectable edgeguarding game, as one exploit of his defenses can cause him to be unable to recover."
Pac-Man,4,7.815,"Pac-Man is currently ranked 23rd out of 82 on the tier list,placing him at the bottom of the A tier; a significant improvement over his appearance in Smash 4 (where he was ranked 45th out of 54). Pac-Man's greatest strengths lie in his zoning capabilities thanks to his barrage of projectiles in Bonus Fruit and Fire Hydrant. Bonus Fruit is notable for having different projectiles with distinguishing properties, with Bell being the most effective one as it confirms into KOs. His Hydrant is notorious for creating a barrier that a lot of characters can struggle to deal with up close, allowing Pac-Man to continue setting up shop behind it. His recovery is among one of, if not, the best recoveries in the game due to its outstanding travel distance of Power Pellet and mixup potential and Pac-Jump giving him a high vertical boost. This makes Pac-Man one of the hardest characters to edgeguard due to his amount of options. Pac-Man's normals are also amazing in their own right as most of them have amazing frame data and shield safety, which allows him to box out his opponents at ease. Finally, his grab, previously seen as one of the worst in Smash 4, has been buffed significantly to increase its hitbox detection, allowing it to even beat spotdodges. Despite his abundance of strengths, Pac-Man has some flaws. Pac-Man has few reliable ways to KO his opponent, with his smash attacks and aerials being pretty predictable, so holding shield can be effective against him. His projectiles can also be used against him, with the Bonus Fruit being able to be caught when shielded and used freely against him, as well as his Hydrant being able to be hit back at him by a strong enough move. His recovery, while amazing, is relatively exploitable, as both moves can be interrupted: Power Pellet can be canceled if the pellet is hit before Pac-Man dashes, and while Pac-Jump allows up to three total uses, it can be used by opponents to recover themselves, or force Pac-Man into helplessness if the trampoline is used three times. Overall, Pac-Man has seen some strong results and representation in both a major and supermajor level from players such as Tea and JDV.","Pac-Man is a middleweight whose attributes deviate slightly from other fighters of his weight class. Although his dashing speed is average, his air speed is slightly above-average and his traction and air acceleration are above-average, Pac-Man's walking speed is slightly below-average, his falling speed is below-average, and his gravity is the 11th-lowest in the game. As a result, these traits make Pac-Man a rather floaty and relatively speedy character for a middleweight, albeit not to the degree of Rosalina & Luma and Mario, respectively. Pac-Man is also able to crawl and wall jump, although the former is generally impractical because of his crouch's tall height.","Pac-Man, like Diddy Kong, is reliant on his item-producing special moves to control the flow of a battle and win in the neutral game. Two special moves, Bonus Fruit and Fire Hydrant, grant him numerous mix-ups for almost any situation. The fruits and objects generated by Bonus Fruit each have different attributes; in addition to functioning as useful spacing, combo, and edge-guarding options, some of them (primarily the apple, melon and key) notably boast respectable KO potential as a way to circumvent the sluggishness and short ranges of Pac-Man's smash attacks. As a result, Bonus Fruit allows Pac-Man to confuse and force movements from his opponents to put them in disadvantageous positions, especially off-stage. When used in the air, Fire Hydrant functions similarly to Stone, which makes it useful for covering landings or breaking combos. It is also Pac-Man's most powerful projectile when launched, which makes it a viable KO option from a distance. In addition to its offensive potential, Fire Hydrant has defensive potential, thanks to its bursts of water possessing a push effect. As a result, the water can be used to create space, gimp poor recoveries, and even force opponents into Pac-Man's attacks. Aside from his projectiles, Pac-Man also possesses a slow, but potent KO option in Power Pellet. Power Pellet also functions both as a great recovery and mindgame option: it can be aimed prematurely and made to curve in creative angles using his Fire Hydrant's push effect, and can function as a KO confirm from Bonus Fruit's bell. Pac-Jump is an effective vertical recovery should all of its trampoline jumps be used, and makes it safe to edge-guard off-stage, as Pac-Man will likely make it back onto the stage. It is also difficult to gimp, especially from an overhead perspective, thanks to Pac-Man's jumps having unblockable hitboxes. Due to its quick start-up and aforementioned hitboxes, Pac-Jump also functions as a good out of shield option when used properly. Outside of his specials, Pac-Man has a good combo game. Though his ground attacks are weak with slight ending lag, Pac-Man's neutral attack and tilt attacks are fast. His tilts, in particular, also give him slightly extended hitboxes (forward tilt and up tilt) or slide him forward (down tilt), letting him attack out of shield easily or poke opponents at a safe distance. Pac-Man's dash attack is one of his best approach options, thanks to it hitting multiple times and having extremely minimal ending lag, the latter of which is very atypical for dash attacks. Pac-Man is also capable in the air; his aerial attacks are fast and can chain into themselves (especially his forward and up aerials). In addition, his neutral and back aerials are effective edge-guarding options; their clean hitboxes also make them useful from out of shield and for KOing, respectively. Unlike in SSB4, Pac-Man has a respectable grab game; he possesses a rather long ranged grab with long lasting hitboxes, giving him a good grab range. His throws have some utility: up throw has combo potential (primarily into neutral and up aerials) at low to medium percentages, whereas down throw has a decent damage output and can set up tech-chases (most notably into Bonus Fruit's key, Power Pellet, dash attack, or a short hopped forward aerial into neutral aerial). Although the lattermost combo does not work on characters whose hurtboxes are low after missing a tech, it is still beneficial, as Pac-Man can instead lock the opponent with a short hopped forward aerial at low to medium percentages. Forward throw can be used for mix-ups due to its minimal ending lag and awkward launching angle, whereas back throw is a decent KO option.","Pac-Man has a few noticeable weakness, however; arguably his biggest one is his inability to KO early because of the overwhelming majority of his moves having low base knockback. Although his tilts and aerials are fast, only Pac-Man's down and clean back aerials can KO at reasonable percentages and especially while near the left or right blast lines. Although Pac-Man's smash attacks can KO easily while near the edge thanks to their respectable damage outputs and knockback growth values, they are very punishable and predictable because of their considerable start-up and ending lag. Although Bonus Fruit's key and a launched Fire Hydrant are viable KO options, the former needs to be charged in order to be accessible, whereas the latter can be easily used against Pac-Man just as he is about to launch it. Additionally, Pac-Man's average overall range and awkward hitboxes can make landing hits or spacing difficult against opponents with long range. His below-average overall mobility can also make it difficult to chase down opponents, create space and/or cycle through Bonus Fruit, especially against rushdown-oriented characters. Pac-Man's grab game, while nowhere near as awful as it was in SSB4, is still flawed in some ways. His grabs, despite being much more consistent, are still somewhat risky due to retaining fairly high ending lag that tether grabs are known for. Although Pac-Man's up throw now has combo potential and his back throw remains a reasonably strong KO option, his forward and down throws leave a lot to be desired. The former throw's higher damage output and base knockback make it only mediocre at best for mix-ups, whereas the latter throw has all but lost its already minimal combo potential due to its ending lag being increased. Despite their perks, all of Pac-Man's special moves can be used against him. Bonus Fruit's objects are items that can only exist once at a time, hence opponents can grab them out of the air, nullifying one of Pac-Man's only projectiles so long as they hold onto it. So long as Bonus Fruit is nullified, Pac-Man is disadvantaged at spacing, KOing and mindgames, while a competent opponent can even use Bonus Fruit's items against him. Fire Hydrant can be turned against him as well; it can be knocked back or reflected by opponents, even in the first few frames when it is released, making it possible for Pac-Man to immediately be dealt noticeable damage. Its push effect also affects him, and can inadvertently cost Pac-Man if he is careless. Despite being strong, Power Pellet is highly predictable and can be interrupted by any attack, which drops a healing Power Pellet that can be used by the opponent. Pac-Jump, despite propelling Pac-Man very high vertically, can also be used by opponents for gimping Pac-Man's own recovery. Due to these possibilities, a good Pac-Man player must keep watch of where his items are in order to inflict the highest knockback possible at a safer range, and avoid his items' abilities being turned against him.","Overall, Pac-Man excels at mindgames and damage racking, yet his moveset's overall low base knockback and average range make him difficult for him to KO opponents early. As a result, he is dependent on utilizing traps and zoning in order to continually deal damage and set up a KO, such as collectively using his air game, Bonus Fruit, and varied recovery to edge-guard. While Pac-Man's special moves grant him a uniquely versatile moveset, they can also hinder him in battle, as one careless move can ultimately decide the momentum of not only himself, but even the whole match itself."
Pokemon Trainer,5,7.608,"PokÃ©mon Trainer is ranked 24th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the top of the A- tier. This is a drastic improvement over his 29th out of 38 placement in Brawl, and a significant improvement over Charizard's placement in Smash 4, where it was ranked 42nd out of 54. This improvement is thanks to the faster PokÃ©mon Change, the ability to use PokÃ©mon Change in mid-air, and the removal of the Stamina and Type effectiveness mechanics. Squirtle, alongside the rest of the PokÃ©mon Trainer's team, is ranked as 24th out of 82 on the official Ultimate tier list. This is a significant improvement over its placement in SSB4, where it was ranked 42nd out of 54, and as a separate character, thus resulting its best placement in the series. Ivysaur, alongside the rest of the PokÃ©mon Trainer's team, is ranked as 24th out of 82 on the official Ultimate tier list. This is a significant improvement over its placement in SSB4, where it was ranked 42nd out of 54, and as a separate character, thus resulting its best placement in the series. Charizard, alongside the rest of the PokÃ©mon Trainer's team, is ranked as 24th out of 82 on the official Ultimate tier list. This is a significant improvement over its placement in SSB4, where it was ranked 42nd out of 54, and as a separate character, thus resulting its best placement in the series.","As one of only three fighters in Ultimate to use the character-swap mechanic (with the other two being with Pyra and Mythra), Pokémon Trainer is arguably the most dynamic fighter in the game, yet also one of the most demanding. Unlike other tag team-oriented fighters, such as Rosalina & Luma and Banjo & Kazooie, the Trainer does not fight directly and instead acts as a commander for his three Pokémon: Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard. Although only one of these Pokémon can be present in battle at any given time, they can be swapped out using Pokémon Change in that order. In the absence of a stamina mechanic, players may use any or all of the three Pokémon freely without fear of becoming less effective. However, forced switching remains, with the player automatically switching to the next Pokémon upon losing a stock.

Each of the three Pokémon covers a different archetype: Squirtle is a fast combo-oriented lightweight, Ivysaur is a middleweight zoner, and Charizard is a super heavyweight with raw KO power and atypically fast mobility despite its slow moves. Typically, the most basic game plan is to build damage with Squirtle at low percents, use Ivysaur to outrange opponents and secure advantage state at medium percents, and score KOs and recover more easily with Charizard.

However, the Pokémon Trainer's versatility allows for a multitude of different game plans depending on the player's preference and the matchup. Pokémon Change has been significantly streamlined from Brawl and has been made significantly faster and can be used in the air. This allows for more effective switching in the heat of the moment so that the current Pokémon can be easily removed from the battle and replaced if it is in a situation where its weaknesses can be easily exploited. This also allows for recovery to be extended further; for example, using Ivysaur's Vine Whip to gain a small amount of vertical height, then switching and using Charizard's Flare Blitz and Fly to provide a very extensive recovery. As such, the Pokémon Trainer can adapt to any situation simply by choosing the right creature for the job, providing for a fighting style similar to 3-on-3 fighting games where the player chooses a team of interchangeable fighters that can be exchanged in an instant.

Despite the advantages provided by the Pokémon Trainer's central mechanic, they do not provide for an infallible fighter. Most notable is the very high learning curve required to master the whole party; all three Pokémon have their own matchups and optimal reactions to different situations, requiring a very high level of commitment to become familiar with each of the three, when to switch Pokémon, and what new situations can arise from switching, requiring commitment akin to having three mains at once in a game where even handling two mains can be overwhelming.

Furthermore, each of the three Pokémon is slightly more specialized in their role than other fighters of their class, and therefore has more pronounced weaknesses. Squirtle's KO power and endurance are lacking, Ivysaur's recovery and disadvantage state are both very poor, and Charizard is susceptible to combos and has mostly unsafe moves. Because Pokémon Change operates in a set order (unlike with Monado Arts) and cannot be continuously spammed due to its cooldown, players cannot always choose which Pokémon to use in which situation and can sometimes be rendered helpless in preventing the current Pokémon's weaknesses from being exploited. This is especially notable in matchups such as Pikachu and Mr. Game & Watch, where two of the three Pokémon are at a disadvantage, resulting in strained efforts to use the one optimal Pokémon as much as possible while keeping the other two on standby.

While attempting to ""solo main"" one of the three Pokémon is possible, it is not recommended in most cases (outside of single-stock modes such as Squad Strike itself, ironically) as players are nonetheless forced to use all three during battle, even while waiting for the cooldown on Pokémon Change. For instance, attempting to ""main"" Charizard while having little knowledge of Squirtle and Ivysaur will allow opponents to exploit the brief windows where using Charizard is not possible. However, it is entirely possible to centralize a playstyle around one or two preferred Pokémon and to use the remaining teammate(s) to complement them, such as with Tweek (who prioritizes Squirtle) and Puppeh (who prioritizes Charizard).

Overall, the Pokémon Trainer is simultaneously one of the most adaptable, most unpredictable, and most challenging fighters to play in Ultimate. As the only fighter that allows the player to bring three completely different characters into battle outside of modes like Squad Strike, the Trainer can enable many different playstyles depending on the player's familiarity and comfort with each of his Pokémon and its matchups. Thanks to the Pokémon Trainer's reworked mechanics and his Pokémon being buffed to varying degrees (with the most notable buffs being the removal of both the Pokémon's stamina and type effectiveness mechanics), he is universally considered to be far superior than he was in Brawl. This has been reflected by his playerbase achieving very notable results in competitive play, with the unique Pokémon Change mechanic and comparative lack of restrictions allowing for a very open-ended game plan. Squirtle is the smallest and lightest out of the PokÃ©mon Trainer's PokÃ©mon, with it being tied with Mr. Game & Watch for the 3rd-lightest character in the game. Squirtle will automatically be the first PokÃ©mon on-screen if PokÃ©mon Trainer is selected, though this can be manually changed by pressing the Y button on the character select screen. In relation to PokÃ©mon change, the order is Squirtle-Ivysaur-Charizard. If Charizard is KOd, Squirtle will always appear on the next revival platform. Ivysaur is one of the characters made playable from PokÃ©mon Trainer, alongside the likes of Squirtle and Charizard. It is a middleweight fighter, having a below average dash and gravity, an average jump height, and high traction. While Squirtle will automatically be the first PokÃ©mon on-screen if PokÃ©mon Trainer is selected, pressing the Y button on the character select screen will toggle Ivysaur as first. In relation to PokÃ©mon change, the order is always Ivysaur-Charizard-Squirtle. If Squirtle is KO'd, Ivysaur will always appear on the next revival platform. Charizard is a super heavyweight fighter and one of the characters made playable from PokÃ©mon Trainer, alongside the likes of Squirtle and Ivysaur. While Squirtle will automatically be the first PokÃ©mon on-screen if PokÃ©mon Trainer is selected, pressing the Y button twice on the character select screen will toggle Charizard as first. In relation to PokÃ©mon Change, the order is always Charizard-Squirtle-Ivysaur. If Ivysaur is KOd, Charizard will always appear on the next revival platform.","As one of only three fighters in Ultimate to use the character-swap mechanic (with the other two being with Pyra and Mythra), PokÃ©mon Trainer is arguably the most dynamic fighter in the game, yet also one of the most demanding.

However, forced switching remains, with the player automatically switching to the next PokÃ©mon upon losing a stock. Each of the three PokÃ©mon covers a different archetype: Squirtle is a fast combo-oriented lightweight, Ivysaur is a middleweight zoner, and Charizard is a super heavyweight with raw KO power and atypically fast mobility despite its slow moves. Typically, the most basic game plan is to build damage with Squirtle at low percents, use Ivysaur to outrange opponents and secure advantage state at medium percents, and score KOs and recover more easily with Charizard. However, the PokÃ©mon Trainer's versatility allows for a multitude of different game plans depending on the player's preference and the matchup. PokÃ©mon Change has been significantly streamlined from Brawl and has been made significantly faster and can be used in the air. This allows for more effective switching in the heat of the moment so that the current PokÃ©mon can be easily removed from the battle and replaced if it is in a situation where its weaknesses can be easily exploited. This also allows for recovery to be extended further; for example, using Ivysaur's Vine Whip to gain a small amount of vertical height, then switching and using Charizard's Flare Blitz and Fly to provide a very extensive recovery. As such, the PokÃ©mon Trainer can adapt to any situation simply by choosing the right creature for the job, providing for a fighting style similar to 3-on-3 fighting games where the player chooses a team of interchangeable fighters that can be exchanged in an instant. Squirtle's small size makes it a hard target to hit, but also gives its attacks (with the exception of its smash attacks) poor range. Squirtle is the fastest of the three available PokÃ©mon and has good mobility overall, with average dashing and air speeds, a fast walking speed, very high air acceleration (the eighth highest), high gravity and high jump height, but a below-average falling speed and low traction. These attributes paired with its good out-of-shield options gives Squirtle a flexible game plan, either functioning as an effective bait-and-punish character or a quick rushdown character. Squirtle also has the ability to crawl and wall cling. One of Squirtle's strengths is its excellent frame data, as all of its attacks outside of its smash attacks come out before frame 10 and generally have low ending lag, also giving it a very strong combo game when combined with the low knockback on some of its moves. Starting with its normal ground moves, the first hit of its neutral attack comes out on frame 2; making it useful as a ""get off me"" option. Forward tilt is one of its most useful tools; the move's low end lag makes it safe on shields, can lead into grabs at lower percentages, and can set up jab locks or tech chases at higher percentages. Up tilt can combo into itself and set up aerial combos. Down tilt, while slow compared to its other moves (coming out at frame 8), has comparably better range and can be useful in 2-framing opponents. Finally, its dash attack can be used to set up combos at low to mid percentages due to its low lag and Squirtle's aforementioned frame data. Squirtle's smash attacks are generally much slower compared to its other moves, but compensate with range and power. Forward smash has high start-up but low end lag, boasts high knockback (being the strongest of its three smash attacks and its strongest move overall), and can be used to finish off a jab lock combo. Its up smash comes out slightly faster than forward smash, hits on both sides simultaneously, and covers a decent area above it. Finally, its down smash is its fastest smash attack and has good range overall, making it effective when used out of a spot dodge. Squirtle possesses a strong aerial game. As one of the only few characters in Ultimate whose five aerials can all be auto-canceled in a short hop, Squirtle has multiple options while in the air. Neutral aerial has very fast startup for an aerial (4 frames), while it can also KO at very high percentages near edges, making it effective for disrupting combos and edgeguarding opponents. Forward and back aerials are good for combos, with both being effective for wall of pain combos and confirming into other options while landing. Due to Squirtle's above average jump height, up aerial is a very effective juggling tool, while the move has among the lowest landing lag of any aerial attack, at 6 frames, furthering its juggling abilities. Its down aerial is a good landing option that can set up combos at low percentages. To cap, all of its aerial attacks have at most 18 frames of landing lag, making them solid air-to-ground options. Squirtle also has a very effective grab game. Despite its below average grab range and unimpressive damage outputs on its throws, they all have a surprising amount of utility. Its forward throw is very effective for edgeguarding and is strong enough to KO at around 160% without rage. Back throw is even stronger, being one of the strongest back throws in Ultimate, while its up and down throws are potent combo starters. Its pummel, while relatively weak as with all pummels in Ultimate, is decently fast and easily builds up damage. Finally, when it comes to Squirtle's special moves, its neutral special, Water Gun functions similarly to Mario's down special, being a move that pushes away opponents without making them flinch. The longer the move is charged, the higher the push back, making it a useful tool for edge guarding and controlling space. Its side special, Withdraw, has Squirtle retreat in its shell and move across the stage at high speeds. It is immune to damage while using this move, which allows it to be used as an approaching tool. Finally, its up special, Waterfall, is a multi-hitting move that covers a decent recovery distance and is useful for ending combos and hitting opponents out of shield. One of Ivysaur's biggest strengths is its range, as its vine-based attacks (neutral attack, up tilt, down tilt, down smash, forward aerial, back aerial, and Vine Whip) all have very generous range that allow Ivysaur to keep foes at a distance with relative ease. Among said attacks, they all either synergize as get-off-me options (down tilt/down smash), mix-up options (up tilt/neutral aerial) or niche KO moves (forward aerial and Vine Whip), which grant Ivysaur a decently effective ranged toolkit. Altogether, this mix gives Ivysaur among the most effective range in the game, made more effective by said moves all having at most 15 frames of startup. Another strength that Ivysaur has is its strong air game. Every aerial Ivysaur has is either a powerful KO move or a potent combo tool and serves as the basis of its powerful advantage state. While its back aerial is among the weakest of aerial attacks in the game, its aforementioned range allows it to keep foes at a distance. Its weak nature allows it to combo into itself at low percentages and at higher percentages can lead into Vine Whip in certain situations. Its neutral aerial has use as a combo extender due to its looping hits using the autolink angle, although its low power makes it easy to intercept. Its up and down aerials are notorious for their KO power and large hitboxes, while its forward aerial, despite its slow startup, is a reliable combo starter into Vine Whip due to its diagonal knockback. Additionally, none of its aerial attacks have more than 17 frames of landing lag, making them good for air-to-ground approaches. Ivysaur's grab game is also useful. While all of its grabs are active on frame 13, they are among the longest-reaching in Ultimate and are decently fast overall, which further adds to Ivysaur's already strong range. To boot, all of its throws deal at least 7% damage. While its forward throw is ironically unsuitable for both combos and KOs due to its high base knockback and low knockback growth, its back throw is a good KO option at the edge, and its up throw is a decent low-percentage combo tool. However, of particular note is its down throw: despite its low damage, its has strong combo potential until around 100%, while its knockback scaling also makes it the strongest down throw in the game, allowing it to KO in situations where back throw cannot. Finally, Ivysaur has a useful array of special moves. Bullet Seed is a fast, multi-hitting attack that hits foes directly above Ivysaur with decent damage, allowing it to work well as an anti-air. Razor Leaf is a projectile that despite its slow startup, lingers for a short time and has low knockback, allowing it to be used effectively for stage control and combo setups. Lastly, Vine Whip is Ivysaur's primary recovery move and a strong KO option when sweetspotted, and like other tethers in Ultimate, has a very long range. Notably, it can hit below the ledge and its animation is very fast, leading to tricky mix-ups for unsuspecting opponents. Charizard deviates from the other super heavyweight characters in mobility. Its ground game provides extensive utility courtesy of its high initial dash and run speed. Also, its normals such as forward tilt and neutral attack are supplemented by skid canceling. Its high traction and quick out-of-shield options like up special and up smash suit its close-quarters combat well. Up smash hits on frame 6, KOs at reliable percents, and functions as an effective juggling and anti-air tool alongside up tilt. Charizard's neutral air is a multi-purpose tool that is useful at starting and extending combos, juggling, edge guarding opponents, and helping Charizard land. It is capable of stringing into itself, forward air, and back air, especially out of a fast fall. Its forward air is fast (frame 8) and has considerable power as a combo finisher and KO tool. Up air renders Charizard's head intangible and is one of the strongest in the game, making it a reliable juggling tool and finisher. It is also a makeshift combo starter at low to middle percent ranges. Back air's power cannot be understated; it features extensive disjoint and a wide diagonal arc that overpowers opponents above and behind Charizard. Down air's sweet spot hitbox is large and powerful, allowing it to easily meteor smash opponents on the ledge and KO at low percents. Charizard's grab game is highly flexible, being capable of setting up combos and positioning the opponent, as well as outright KOing them. Having minimal ending lag, back throw is a versatile combo tool that leads to the likes of forward air, back air, and reverse neutral air. It positions the opponent off-stage at higher percents as well. Down throw fills the combo starter role like back throw, though it is much less effective. Forward throw has higher knockback than back throw, being able to set up edge guards and ledge traps earlier, as well as KO'ing at higher percents. Up throw works as a last-resort KO option at 150% and above, or earlier on stages with platforms. Of Charizard's special moves, Flamethrower sees the most utility, having a long range and being able to angle up or down. It pressures opponents to approach, counteracts weak projectiles, and is a useful ledge-trapping move. Fly has super armor at its startup, not only granting Charizard a safer recovery but also a reliable option out of parry against attacks with multiple hits. Flare Blitz is a strong hard-punish attack that effectively tech chases opponents and inflicts significant damage and knockback. Overall, Charizard's main benefits include its robust advantage state, damage-racking capabilities, and KO potential. It can build significant damage from just a few hits thanks to its high returns from its combos and strings, mainly out of its back throw. Charizard is the most advantaged when it is below the opponent. Its neutral air, up tilt, up smash, and back air are disjointed and cover wide arcs against opponents above it. Charizard also comes with respectable edgeguarding and ledge-trapping abilities. Flamethrower covers many get-up options when adequately spaced, and the player can punish them on reaction with down smash, up smash, forward tilt, or neutral air. Forward tilt (angled downwards) and down smash are also capable of hitting characters at the ledge.","As one of only three fighters in Ultimate to use the character-swap mechanic (with the other two being with Pyra and Mythra), PokÃ©mon Trainer is arguably the most dynamic fighter in the game, yet also one of the most demanding. Unlike other tag team-oriented fighters, such as Rosalina & Luma and Banjo & Kazooie, the Trainer does not fight directly and instead acts as a commander for his three PokÃ©mon: Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard. Although only one of these PokÃ©mon can be present in battle at any given time, they can be swapped out using PokÃ©mon Change in that order. In the absence of a stamina mechanic, players may use any or all of the three PokÃ©mon freely without fear of becoming less effective. However, forced switching remains, with the player automatically switching to the next PokÃ©mon upon losing a stock. Each of the three PokÃ©mon covers a different archetype: Squirtle is a fast combo-oriented lightweight, Ivysaur is a middleweight zoner, and Charizard is a super heavyweight with raw KO power and atypically fast mobility despite its slow moves. Typically, the most basic game plan is to build damage with Squirtle at low percents, use Ivysaur to outrange opponents and secure advantage state at medium percents, and score KOs and recover more easily with Charizard. However, the PokÃ©mon Trainer's versatility allows for a multitude of different game plans depending on the player's preference and the matchup. PokÃ©mon Change has been significantly streamlined from Brawl and has been made significantly faster and can be used in the air. This allows for more effective switching in the heat of the moment so that the current PokÃ©mon can be easily removed from the battle and replaced if it is in a situation where its weaknesses can be easily exploited. This also allows for recovery to be extended further; for example, using Ivysaur's Vine Whip to gain a small amount of vertical height, then switching and using Charizard's Flare Blitz and Fly to provide a very extensive recovery. As such, the PokÃ©mon Trainer can adapt to any situation simply by choosing the right creature for the job, providing for a fighting style similar to 3-on-3 fighting games where the player chooses a team of interchangeable fighters that can be exchanged in an instant. However, Squirtle does have some weaknesses. While Squirtle has high combo potential, the damage output from its individual attacks is poor overall, and outside of its smash attacks (which are extremely slow and committal) and its back throw (which can have trouble killing away from the ledge), Squirtle lacks any reliable KO options, especially since some of its previous KO options were weakened. Up aerial can only KO near the upper blast line and along with forward throw, requires rage to KO on its own, while its other aerials need edgeguarding to KO at all. Squirtle lacks reliable kill confirms as well, making it very difficult for Squirtle to close out stocks on its own if it is incapable of edgeguarding the opponent. Squirtle's light weight and exploitable recovery also make its endurance very poor, and it is no longer resistant to fire attacks due to the removal of type effectiveness, further hindering Squirtle's endurance in certain matchups. As previously mentioned, Squirtle has poor range throughout its attacks (save for its smash attacks), and it lacks a damaging projectile, making it very easy for Squirtle to be out-spaced by characters with superior range. Squirtle's offstage game is also poor. While all of its aerial attacks can autocancel in a short hop, they are all very weak (barring neutral aerial) and cannot KO reliably on their own, while lacking range compared to other aerials. This flaw is further pronounced with the removal of meteor canceling due to Squirtle's very light weight, while it lacks a meteor smash of any kind unlike Ivysaur and Charizard. Finally, while Withdraw works well as a recovery option and mindgame tool, it has a unique flaw: if Squirtle is footstooled during the move's animation, it will be left unable to input any actions for 120 frames, leaving it extremely vulnerable both in the air and on the ground, requiring caution when using the move. However, Ivysaur is held back by various flaws. Perhaps Ivysaur's most prominent issue is its ground game: while its tilt attacks have strong range, they are also equally lacking in power. Down tilt serves as a quick ""get-off-me"" option, and is his fastest grounded option at frame 4. Up tilt hits directly above Ivysaur and can lead into up air at certain percentages, though it does not have a scoop hitbox, leading to it being a niche move at best. While its smash attacks possess high power, they are generally predictable due to slow startup. Its up smash is among the strongest in the game, but it has very slow startup at 26 frames, while its horizontal range renders it hard to approach with against grounded opponents. Down smash suffers from the opposite problem: while decently fast, it fails to KO until very high percentages, a fact made worse by its sourspots. Arguably its most useful smash attack is forward smash, which when timed correctly can cover all ledge options and is generally safe on shield at full range. Its dash attack is a good burst option, but also suffers from low knockback scaling and cannot KO reliably. Finally, due to said problems, Ivysaur is very susceptible to stale-move negation, meaning it will almost constantly rely on its ranged attacks, all of which deal low damage. Ivysaur also has a problematic recovery. While its up and down aerials provide different vertical movement options, they are only useful when close to the stage due to their ending lag. Vine Whip has long range as a tether, but only works if Ivysaur is sufficiently close to a ledge, where it is susceptible to stage spikes. Altogether, this makes it infeasible for Ivysaur to recover when above the stage, where any sufficiently strong semi-spike or meteor smash can potentially keep it away from ledges. Finally, due to a lackluster air speed and falling speed, Ivysaur is highly susceptible to juggle situations and has a poor overall disadvantage state. Although Ivysaur has a plethora of amazing aerials, none of them are particularly effective in disadvantage and without a jump Ivysaur has few options to get back on the ground. Ivysaur has the opportunity to switch to Charizard for better air speed and another jump, but such options are committal and can lead to an even further punish. Charizard's neutral game is considered mediocre. Flamethrower's decay prevents it from being usable for a long time, and its few safe-on-shield options, such as back air, neutral air, and forward tilt, require precise spacing and timing for the highest benefit. Its moveset contains several flaws that offset its strengths, including forward air not being able to autocancel out of a short hop. Thus, its moveset requires high commitment, resulting in heavy reliance on movement and reads to control the tempo of the game. While Charizard can maintain a strong advantage state, its moveset is built to cover paths the opponent is taking instead of juggling them aggressively. Charizardâ€™s biggest weakness is against characters that can rush it down with combos such as Squirtle, Mario, Palutena, Lucina, and Corrin, as its few combo-breaking moves are either too risky or too slow to be consistent in this application.","Overall, the PokÃ©mon Trainer is simultaneously one of the most adaptable, most unpredictable, and most challenging fighters to play in Ultimate. As the only fighter that allows the player to bring three completely different characters into battle outside of modes like Squad Strike, the Trainer can enable many different playstyles depending on the player's familiarity and comfort with each of his PokÃ©mon and its matchups. Thanks to the PokÃ©mon Trainer's reworked mechanics and his PokÃ©mon being buffed to varying degrees (with the most notable buffs being the removal of both the PokÃ©mon's stamina and type effectiveness mechanics), he is universally considered to be far superior than he was in Brawl. This has been reflected by his playerbase achieving very notable results in competitive play, with the unique PokÃ©mon Change mechanic and comparative lack of restrictions allowing for a very open-ended game plan. Overall, Squirtle should mainly be used to quickly rack up damage with its strong combo game while it and its opponents are at lower percents, and should almost invariably be swapped out with Ivysaur or Charizard at later percents due to their superior neutral games, survivability, and KO potential. Altogether, Ivysaur fills the ""zoner"" role for Pokemon Trainer's lineup, with its long range, disjointed attacks, and projectile allowing it to excel at keeping opponents out. It is the middle of the three in weight, and is usually used around mid-high percent because of its strong advantage state, combos, and zoning ability. If the player wishes to centralize their gameplan around Ivysaur, knowledge of Charizard is recommended. Charizard's immense power in combination with their similar range to Ivysaur's allows a player to switch between a defensive zoner and offensive aerial gameplan that allows them to keep control over the pace of a battle with ease. Additionally, Charizard's wealth of recovery options and additional mid-air jump covers Ivysaur's lackluster recovery, and their super heavyweight status gives them an edge when staying alive for as long as possible is required. All in all, Charizard is a well-rounded super heavyweight but has the weakest auto-pilot of the three PokÃ©mon in the PokÃ©mon Trainer's party. It must rely on sheer mobility and player interaction and must work around the glaring problems its moveset contains. Charizard can function both offensively and defensively in the neutral, but it is up to the player to find the most advantageous position in this spectrum. Once it gains advantage, it must capitalize on the opponent's mistakes to the greatest extent for the highest return. While Charizard is fully functional as an individual fighter like Squirtle and Ivysaur, it is the PokÃ©mon of choice at 120% and above. Its high weight lets it survive blows that would otherwise be fatal to Squirtle and Ivysaur. Also, especially with rage, many of its attacks have the KO power required to swiftly finish an opponent already weakened by the other two PokÃ©mon. Charizard can be considered the best super heavyweight in the game as its Trainer can call on it when its strength, endurance, and recovery are needed and remove it from situations that exploit the weaknesses it shares with fighters of its weight class. While Charizard requires more skill and prediction to use to its full potential than Squirtle and Ivysaur, PokÃ©mon Trainers that have mastered the Flame PokÃ©mon will be rewarded significantly with the options that it brings to the table. If the player wishes to centralize their gameplan around Charizard, knowledge of Squirtle is recommended. It excels in areas where Charizard tends to be weak (combos, evasion, and frame data) and can be used most effectively in situations where Charizard would struggle, especially in racking up damage and avoiding enemy combos at low percents. Muscle memory with Squirtle can supplement Charizard's own combo game and movement as well."
Shulk,5,7.558,"Shulk is ranked 25th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the A- tier. This is a significant improvement from his 34th out of 54 placement in SSB4. One of Shulk's greatest strengths is his enormous disjointed range, courtesy of the Monado. This allows him to outrange almost every fighter in the game, which gives Shulk one of the most effective spacing capabilities relative to the rest of the cast. Shulk can further enhance his strengths through the usage of Monado Arts. They allow him to change his stats on command, depending on the art selected. To name a few, Speed Art allows him to run faster and improve his approach and Buster Art gives him increased damage output in exchange for less knockback, allowing for high-damaging combos. Shield Art, in particular, is notorious for breaking out of combos due to decrease knockback taken. Despite the amount of strengths, Shulk is not flawless. He still retains his sluggish frame data and startup of a majority of his moves, making him prone to getting parry punished or overwhelmed by faster moves. His recovery is also fairly exploitable due to Air Slash being his only main recovery option and if it gets disrupted, he can lose his stock fairly early if he has used his midair jump, even with Jump Art in store. Speaking of Monado Arts, despite giving Shulk upgrades, they also grant multiples downsides. For example, while Smash Art gives him better KO power, it also greatly increases knockback taken, giving Shulk a worse endurance than even Pichu while in Smash Art, giving it some risk to using it. Finally, Shulk is one of the most difficult characters to master since he has a lot of advanced techniques, and properly using Monado Arts mid-match has to account for fast decision-making to see which art is best suited for each situation.","Shulk is a middleweight swordsman who sports average walking speed, dashing speed, falling speed, and gravity. When coupled with his above-average air speed and his below-average air acceleration, Shulk's overall mobility is average to the point of lacking any obvious advantages or disadvantages.","Shulk's greatest asset is his disjointed range: thanks to the Monado, Shulk possesses some of the longest overall disjoints in the game. Shulk's excellent range allows him to punish careless moves by retaliating at a distance, or create space by challenging his opponent with his disjointed attacks. His most useful grounded moves are his up tilt and smash attacks, each of which possess distinct perks. His up tilt boasts outstanding vertical range, can cover multiple get-up options from the edge, and can KO at very high percentages, whereas his smash attacks boast high power and long ranges. Shulk also boasts a very strong aerial game as his powerful aerials have a great combination of large hitbox size, long hitbox duration, and low landing lag, which plays a key role in his approach and spacing games. Both his neutral and forward aerials possess wide-arced ranges with low landing lag, making them Shulk's best approach options. The former is useful for anything from starting combos to covering landing options thanks to its long-lasting hitbox and low landing lag, while the latter's wide range and dependable speed makes it a very good edge-guarding and spacing option. His back aerial is a capable KOing option due to it being Shulk's most powerful aerial, with its high horizontal range also allowing it to space or poke from a distance. Lastly, his up and down aerials are, like his back aerial, thrusts instead of slashes. As such, they have minimal horizontal ranges, but can KO surprisingly early should they hit, with the former being potent near the upper blast line, whereas the latter is capable of meteor smashing. Much like in his home game, Shulk is a character who revolves around adapting to different situations with his attribute-enhancing Monado Arts. Each Art tweaks his attributes considerably for a certain amount of time (10 seconds for Buster, 8 seconds for Speed and Smash, and 6 seconds for Jump and Shield) and can be manually canceled at any time, even immediately after hitstun ends or during landing lag. With this freedom, Shulk can activate an Art to open up options for virtually any situation while still being able to switch or cancel them if he is in a challenging position. Jump grants him significant aerial mobility by making his jumps the highest in the game while improving both his air speed and Air Slash's height. This grants him an incredible recovery, allowing him to recover from almost anywhere off-stage, edge-guard more aggressively and even perform several KO combos, such as a wall of pain leading to a sacrificial Air Slash at medium percentages. Speed amplifies his typically average grounded mobility while reducing his jump height, making his ground-to-air transitions more efficient for aerial combos and spacing, while allowing him to approach and retreat noncommittally. It also lowers traction, making Shulk's pivot grab amongst the longest in the game for its duration. These two Arts grant him outstanding mobility, and when combined with the large hitboxes of his attacks, Shulk can effectively space opponents out of a specific side of the stage with either Jump or Speed, making him very difficult to approach on stages with platforms. Shield bolsters Shulk's defensive game by reducing both damage and knockback received, which allows him to survive for a much longer period of time and resist getting trapped in combos. His shield also becomes much more durable, making it harder to break with shield-breaking attacks such as Bowser Bomb. Buster reduces his overall knockback, but increases his overall damage output, allowing him to rack up damage extremely quickly. Buster also makes up and down throws effective and damaging combo starters at 0%, while the increased damage and shieldstun make Shulk's moves both safer on shield and capable of pressuring shields. Lastly, Smash boosts his entire moveset's knockback, making almost all of Shulk's attacks into viable KOing options (especially with rage), and his down throw becomes the strongest in the game while it is active. Despite his fastest aerial coming out on frame 13 and starting behind him, Shulk has a particular strength in combo breaking. The Shield Art is among the best combo breakers in the game, since it makes him fall out of all combos. He can also switch to the Smash Art at low percentages as another way to escape combos, thanks to it noticeably heightening the knockback he receives. Thanks to the Monado Arts, Shulk is highly adaptive, and usually has an easier time mixing up his playstyle compared to other characters so long as his Arts are used effectively and in tandem with his powerful air game. Such an example would be constantly switching from Jump and Shield to stall a losing match, or activating different arts while being juggled to affect Shulk's falling speed, and hence mess up an opponent's combo. It also allows him to use rage effectively, especially when combined with Shield in order to survive and accumulate rage, or with Smash for a risky, yet powerful boost in knockback. Due to the technical aspects of activating Monado Arts, Shulk also has access to multiple unique advanced techniques, the most notable of which is known as Monado Art landing lag canceling. By jumping and timing the activation of an Art just before landing, Shulk can reduce the landing lag of his aerials to 5 frames while gaining intangibility for 14 frames (1 frame less than the length granted by his sidestep). While difficult to perform, it allows Shulk to avoid punishment before immediately responding with a punish of his own, or start shield break combos, such as an Art canceled back aerial to forward smash. It can even let him retreat by pivoting in midair, or extend the invincibility of air dodging via an aerial Art activation. This technique is the only viable way to make some of Shulk's moves (such as back aerial) safe on shield against faster characters. Several other techniques include the Monado Purge, a 50/50 KO set-up consisting of an up throw to up aerial at high percentages, and Monado Art ledge snap, which bypasses edge get-up animations while protecting the user with brief intangibility. When mastered, Shulk's Monado Art techniques can be very effective and unpredictable mix-up options that are inaccessible by any other character. Excluding his Arts, Shulk's special moveset shares his overall high range, and all have their own forms of utility. Back Slash is very powerful when striking the opponent's back and has long range regardless, making it a great surprise attack as well as a decent spacing tool. Air Slash grants a good amount of vertical distance, comes out quickly, and has strong knockback growth, making it a good recovery move and an even better out of shield option. The distance and knockback of Air Slash can additionally be affected by the Jump and Smash Arts respectively, allowing the move to gain even more vertical distance, or be used as a combo finisher in the air or a KO option out-of-shield. Lastly, Vision is tied with Double Team for having the longest lasting counterattack window in the game when fresh while also having the longest range, both of which give Shulk one of the most effective counters of any character. Its alternate counterattack, which is performed when Shulk inputs the direction from which the triggered attack came from, also rivals Counter Surge as the strongest counterattack in the game.","However, Shulk has some exploitable weaknesses. Despite being buffed in Ultimate, his moveset is still mostly sluggish. Aside from his neutral attack, standing grab and Vision, all his other attacks do not hit before frame 10, and majority of his moveset has more than 25 frames of ending lag. Like the aforementioned heavyweights, this means he has to rely on careful reads to land a hit, as a missed attack can easily be capitalized upon. This is made worse by the low shieldstun of his attacks (unless Buster is active), making his attacks inherently unsafe up close and on shield, while still unsafe if spaced against faster characters prevalent in the metagame. Additionally, despite his excellent range, most of Shulk's moves deal more damage with the Monado's blade rather than its beam blade, while several of his strongest combos (such as a landing neutral aerial to a grab or a forward aerial wall of pain) rely on him being extremely close to his opponent/affected by rage to be inescapable, due to his beam blade's lower hitstun. As a result, Shulk is required to take risks before he can start performing any significant combos. His sluggish frame data also extends to his aerials. Shulk is the only character who cannot auto-cancel any of his aerials before their entire duration is over, forcing him to endure landing lag every time he starts an aerial attack, even from a double jump (with the exception of forward aerial). While Monado Art landing lag canceling can negate this, it is considerably more complicated to perform compared to auto-canceling, making it very difficult and unwieldy to perform consistently. Essentially, this makes every attack very committal, and makes it important for Shulk to space his attacks carefully as he can easily be punished for missing. Additionally, moves such as back aerial or up aerial are unsafe to use upon landing; unlike many other characters' aerials, their hitboxes only appear after a pause, making it possible to land before an attack even comes out while causing Shulk to suffer from landing lag. His lack of a projectile and anti-projectile options also makes it difficult to pressure his opponent from a distance, while making it hard for him to approach against projectile users as well. Even pressure on the ground can be hard to escape from, as Shulk has the fifth lowest traction in the game. This gives him a poor out of shield game without Air Slash, which is punishable when missed. Shulk's special attacks are also flawed in some ways. Back Slash's knockback is exceptionally weak if hitting the opponent's front, being unsafe on hit at low percentages, has considerable ending lag, and is notorious for its inability to edge sweetspot. Air Slash provides very minimal horizontal momentum and does not sweetspot edges immediately unless the second slash is inputted right beside an edge, thus making his recovery predictable, even with Jump. Lastly, Vision's counter window decays upon consecutive use, which discourages frequent usage. The Monado Arts also have debuffs to compensate for their buffs: if an Art is active, it causes some of his other attributes to drop, weakening some of his abilities. A careful opponent can potentially take advantage of them to gain the upper hand, making his Arts a double-edged sword due to his reliance on them to approach and/or perform combos. Jump makes him take very high damage, and when combined with his slow moveset, makes it even riskier to whiff a move. Speed lowers his damage output, requiring him to deal more hits for the same amount of damage and reduces his jump force to the point of hindering his vertical mobility. Shield drastically reduces his mobility and damage output to the point of making his recovery and offensive potential among the worst in the game. When coupled with his worsened mobility, Shield's increased knockback defense also leaves Shulk heavily susceptible to combos and juggling. Buster increases his vulnerability to damage to the same degree as Jump, while its lower knockback drastically lowers Shulk's KO potential to the point that his smash attacks will not KO until past 150%. Finally, Smash drastically lowers his endurance, hinders his combo game, and makes his attacks the least damaging in the game. Even having no Arts active is disadvantageous, as Shulk's balanced attributes do not allow him to easily approach or catch up with opponents. Having no Arts active also hinders him offensively: very few of Shulk's moves possess combo potential past low percentages, and all his smash attacks are punishable because of their high ending lag. This forces Shulk to be reliant on edge-guarding and spacing while waiting for an Art to refresh, and requires him to capitalize on the duration of a needed Art to the fullest in order to perform certain techniques (such as combo strings or approaching), compared to other characters who may have the ability to do so at any time.","Overall, Shulk's optimal playstyle consists of warding off pressure and having extensive knowledge of his opponent. His range, unique toolkit, and versatile tech grant him powerful abilities when mastered, with some being inaccessible to any other character in the roster, however players must have reliable spacing skill as whiffing one of his moves can leave him wide open and vulnerable to heavy damage. While his weaknesses are exploitable when fighting head-on, his adaptability allows him to excel when played patiently and while exploiting openings. Regardless, Shulk has an extremely high learning curve because of a combination of sluggish attacks and very demanding techniques, as extensive knowledge of Monado Arts, proper spacing, reads and patient play are each required for him to thrive."
Bayonette,5,7.458,"Bayonetta is currently ranked 26th out of 82 characters on the current tier list, placing her in A- tier. This is a big drop from her placement in Smash 4 where she was considered to be the best character in the game. Bayonetta's main strength is her unique, powerful combo game. Her special attacks, Witch Twist and After Burner Kick, allow her to reliably combo and inflict heavy damage on opponents, sometimes dragging them into the top or side blast zones and leading to an early KO. Bayonetta can also rack up damage rather quickly, as all of her tilt attacks confirm into multiple follow-ups at early percentages. Furthermore, Bayonetta possesses a plethora of defensive options, the most effective being Witch Time and Bat Within. A successful activation of Witch Time at low percents can open an opportunity for a combo, while an activation at high percents can often confirm into a KO. Bat Within, a frame 1 airdodge, allows her to move away in the direction that her player chooses, allowing her to escape semi-true combos, juggles, and even kill confirms, while in turn allowing her to reverse disadvantage and punish her opponent. Finally, Bayonetta has an oppressive offstage game thanks to her flexible aerial game, while Witch Twist and After Burner Kick give her a long, flexible, and mostly safe recovery. However, Bayonetta has several weaknesses that hold her back, the most notable being her raw kill power. She tends to have a harder time KOing at higher percents, as her best KO options, particularly sweetspot back-air, down-air, jab, and her smash attacks, are difficult to land or combo into at high percents. This is compounded by her light weight and tall frame, which means opponents could KO her first if she is unable to take their stock. In addition, Bayonetta's frame data is below-average, with almost all of her attacks coming out on frame 9 or later, and most of them also have high ending lag and deal minimal shield damage, making them unsafe on shield. As such, her ground game is rather poor, which in turn affects her combo game, as she often relies on Heel Slide, up tilt, or down tilt in order to start combos. Finally, her combos have their own drawbacks: not only are they susceptible to SDI, but the more special moves she uses during an aerial combo, the more landing lag she receives, up to 50 frames, making them punishable if whiffed. Overall, Bayonetta is a combo-oriented character that can rack up damage quickly and KO at early percents, however she tends to struggle at higher percents due to her poor approach and limited KO options outside of her combos. Early results from Bayonetta were lackluster, leading to a negative initial perception, however numerous buffs from balance patches helped improve her viability over time, particularly in the post-online metagame, and she has since garnered a large playerbase and a plethora of strong results from players such as Bloom4Eva, Lima, and TamaPDaifuku.","Bayonetta is a tall yet light character. She has a below average walking and air speed, average traction and dashing speed (with a decently fast initial dash), very fast air acceleration and fall speed, high gravity, and very high jumps â€“ she has the 8th highest air jump, is tied with Sheik for the 7th highest ground jump, and tied with Zero Suit Samus for the 2nd highest short hop. These attributes give her somewhat poor endurance (especially vertically) and average mobility, but a considerable degree of agility in the air when combined with her movement-based aerial special moves.","Bayonetta's biggest strengths are her strong aerial combo game â€“ with her tilt attacks, forward aerial, up aerial, neutral aerial and special moves being capable of starting or extending combos â€“ and her excellent recovery, which allows her to reach the stage from the bottom blast zone while being difficult to edgeguard due to her recovery's flexibility. Her damage output per hit is somewhat low, but her extensive combo game makes up for this, as her combos can quickly and easily rack up damage. She has a number of unique attributes, such as her Bullet Arts, which allows her to shoot from the guns on her hands and heels by keeping the attack button pressed down after most of her attacks. Because they are programmed as disjointed hitboxes, they are not classified as projectiles and thus cannot be reflected, making them a solid pressuring and peppering tool. She also possesses a special Fighter ability in Bat Within, which activates if struck during the earliest frames of her dodges or in the latest frames of her down special; this causes her to morph into a flock of bats, receive half damage without taking any knockback, and move in the direction inputted to initiate the dodge (for spot dodges she remains in place, and for neutral air dodges she moves downward). Because the ability can activate on frame 1 of a dodge input, Bayonetta effectively posesses the fastest combo-breaking defensive option out of the entire roster, allowing her to evade combos that would otherwise be unavoidable for nearly all others in the cast. Her up special has a large hitbox above and around her, is one of few in the game that don't cause helplessness upon use, can be used a second time following a double jump, and can be used to cancel her double jump and preserve it, allowing her a vertical recovery that surpasses many other fighters; combined with her side special, Bayonetta is nearly impossible to contest when returning to stage. Additionally, she can also wall cling and wall jump, giving her further movement options on certain stages. Bayonetta's ground game is lackluster and reliant on her tilt attacks to help set up intricate combos. Her jab is slow, but the final hit of the rapid jab can KO at high percentages. Her dash attack has considerable startup for an attack of its kind (15 frames), but moves very quickly once initiated and can also serve as a situational KO move. Both her up tilt and her down tilt have small hitboxes, but they are very good combo tools: up tilt is useful for getting her opponents into the air and also combos from her Heel Slide or into her Witch Twist, up aerial, or back aerial depending on the percentage, with up tilt into back air being a semi-reliable kill confirm while her down tilt is a good out-of-shield option and has similar combo potential. Her forward tilt is her least useful tilt as it lacks follow-up options beyond very low percents, but it can provide mix-up options on shield depending on whether one, two or all three hits of the move and optional Bullets Arts timing stalls are used. Bayonetta's smash attacks allow her to summon Madama Butterfly's limbs. They each have good knockback and range, but they also have low priority and noticeable lag, meaning that attempting to use one (even in Witch Time) can cause them to clank with other grounded moves and lead her to get punished, although Madama Butterfly's limbs have transcendent priority against aerial attacks. Her forward smash is her earliest KO option and one of her only attacks that can reliably kill before 100%, though it has a blind spot directly in front of Bayonetta. Her up smash covers the area directly in front of her and can KO from the upper blast line. Her down smash covers the same range as her up smash and is mainly useful for meteor smashing her opponents from the ledge, though it can also kill from the upper blast line at higher percentages. Bayonetta's air game is potent as a result of her high jumps, flexible movement options, extremely quick aerial attacks that generally provide generous coverage, and ability to fight offstage while confidently being able to return due to her superb recovery potential. Her neutral aerial has great range (especially when extended with Bullet Arts, which covers a huge area around her), can lead to combos into forward aerial and After Burner Kick, and can be a KO option offstage or at very high percentages. Back aerial is one of her strongest KO options because of its sweetspot and is a good combo finisher, though it is one of the slower back aerials in the game (coming out at frame 11). Her forward aerial can edgeguard and, like her forward tilt, forms a three-hit combo of its own if pressed repeatedly; it can also be used as a combo starter or extender. Her up aerial is extremely fast, hits high above her in a circular arc, and serves as a useful juggling tool, though it has very low knockback. Her down aerial is a stall-then-fall move which is a risky landing option due to its high ending lag, though it has a strong landing hit which can be a useful KO option; the hitbox on the heel of her leg also possesses a modrately strong spiking hitbox, allowing for surprise KOs off the bottom blast line if used properly. She has very useful special moves that are essential for her uniquely air-based combo and pressure game. Her neutral special Bullet Climax fires projectiles at a slightly upward angle and is useful for KOing higher-percentage opponents at the left and right blast lines when fully charged. Both variations of her side special, Heel Slide and After Burner Kick are reliable combo starters, while the latter is also a good combo extender and horizontal recovery option. After Burner Kick can be used either to ascend slightly or descend steeply, depending on the input used. Her up special Witch Twist is her best out-of-shield option and is a great tool for starting and extending combos and dragging the opponent to the upper blast line. Though it gains little vertical distance in isolation, it can be performed twice with Bayonetta's double jump, and she can also jump cancel her second jump to grant her extra vertical distance, giving her outstanding vertical and horizontal recovery potential. Her down special counter Witch Time has a short duration and high ending lag, but it slows down time for a brief period if it activates. If Bayonetta gets hit in a specific time frame when dodging or in the later frames of Witch Time, she will activate her Bat Within. This turns her into bats and moves her to a (usually) more favorable stage position, and she will take half of the attack's damage output and no knockback. Bayonetta's aerial prowess, set of special moves, and fighter abilities grant her a strong disadvantage state, as she can avoid pressure using her dizzyingly fast air acceleration to weave back and forth, use her very high double jump to escape fighters who can't chase her, punish approaches with After Burrner Kick or Witch Twist, create strong reversals with Witch Time, or dodge otherwise fatal attacks with Bat Within. Her very fast aerial attacks complement her ability to keep opponents guessing where she will travel and whether she will pick an offensive or defensive option. Her grab and throw game has some utility, though to a lesser extent than the rest of her moveset. While up throw and down throw lack true follow-up potential outside of reads and mix-ups, the latter serves as a KO option at very high percentages. Additionally, while forward throw and back throw are purely positional throws, the former is her strongest kill throw, though its kill potential can easily be mitigated with proper DI.","To counter her many unique strengths, Bayonetta has very noticeable flaws. Most notably, while she can quickly rack up damage with her combos, she has very few reliable KO options until around 150%, with her only real kill options before this being her smash attacks, back air, down air, and jab. Even then, these options are relatively mediocre; her smash attacks are slow, often get cancelled out by other moves and have spots with no hitbox; her back air has slow start-up and a relatively small sweetspot hitbox; her down air is a laggy move that only KOs if it hits the opponent with certain hitboxes or while they're grounded; and her jab has very high start-up and ending lag, making it an incredibly risky kill option and very easy to punish if shielded. Even at percentages higher than 150%, her KO options are unreliable, extremely punishable if whiffed or only KO at very high percentages, for example her forward throw and dash attack. Thus to mitigate her raw kill potential, Bayonetta needs to earn stocks through successful edgeguards using her fearsome air game, or more situationally through the use of hard reads using Witch Time. Furthermore, Bayonetta has very poor frame data on the ground, with all of her standard grounded moves coming out at frame 7 or slower while also being unsafe on shield. This makes Bayonetta's approach among the worst in the entire cast, effectively forcing her to play a very defensive, bait-and-punish style which the opponent can counter by simply shielding or not approaching her. In addition, the fact that Bayonetta is a tall character with a fast fall speed and light weight means she is more easily comboed and more susceptible to being KO'd â€“ especially when stuffed out by sufficiently strong anti-airs. Though Bat Within can somewhat alleviate the former problem, the issues compound to give her poor survivability. Her passive abilities also have issues. While Bat Within has utility in the context of on-stage disadvantage, it is essentially a worse spot dodge on the ground, as Bayonetta will still take half of the dodged attack's damage if it is triggered. In the air, Bat Within has other problems: the fact that it only sends her downward when triggered in the air means that it can cause SDs while she is offstage, and to balance the fact that Bat Within is so fast, the distance Bayonetta covers when using a directional air dodge is minimal. Bayonetta is subject to several other weaknesses: unlike most other fighters, her Smash attacks can only be held for 60 frames instead of 120 (Mega Man, Ness, Olimar, and Villager also share this weakness); her Witch Time becomes less effective with every use, even when it isn't triggered by an attack; and Bayonetta's combos themselves, while arguably her strongest asset, are still ineffective against good SDI. Additionally, Bayonetta suffers from having potentially some of the highest landing lag in the game, as her landing lag increases based on how many specials she has used in the air. As a result, she can be immobile upon landing for up to 50 frames. Though she has ways to get around this - for example, using Witch Time or Bullet Climax to cancel her landing lag, landing with an aerial to force the opponent away, or retreating to a ledge â€“ these are ultimately situational, and a whiffed combo can lead to a big punish.","Overall, Bayonetta is seen as a character with a high skill cap because of her extensive and complex combo game, her high-risk playstyle, and her unique abilities and techniques. She is a flexible, air-based, combo-oriented character who is good at quickly racking up damage and applying pressure to opponents, but her lack of reliable KO options means she can struggle in securing the stock (an issue which is exacerbated by her being prone to combos and kill setups herself)."
Corrin,5,7.382,"Corrin is ranked 27th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the A- tier. This is a slight drop from his 13th out of 54 placement in SSB4. Corrin's main strength is his range, courtesy of the disjointed hitboxes of the Yato Blade, which pairs well with his high damage output and good frame data for a swordsman. This gifts him with an amazing neutral and advantage state, and an extremely reliable combo game thanks to his aerials having consistent combos at most percent ranges. Corrin also possesses strong neutral game options as he has multiple attacks that can force a reaction from opponents, with held forward smash whittling down shields and can cause a shield stab or shield break if not reacted properly to, while Dragon Fang Shot has two separate chargeable portions which can punish careless shielding up close. Dragon Lunge serves as the centerpiece of Corrin's gameplan: it consists of an initial pin and followup attack that can be cancelled into an attack or various movement options, further enhancing Corrin's mixup options. It additionally serves as a recovery extender if it pins onto a wall, and is a potent edgeguarding tool thanks to its range and low diagonal hitbox, allowing it to easily 2 frame punish recovering opponents with low risk to Corrin. Finally, Corrin's recovery is dependable as Dragon Ascent provides flexible distance onstage and excellent protection thanks to its intangibility and large hitboxes, while he can further aid his recovery by using back air. Overall, Corrin's toolset give him amazing frame trapping, combo, and juggling potential, as well as a formidable advantage state especially while edgeguarding, with his punish game being freeflow and generally safe. However, Corrin has notable weaknesses, most of which revolve around his poor mobility and disadvantage state. In spite of his excellent combo potential, Corrin's poor ground speed and lack of effective defensive options causes him to struggle to win neutral, as he is forced to be aggressive in approaching or catching up to faster characters and zoners. In the event he does lose neutral, his disadvantage state is poor due to his mediocre out of shield game and moves that aren't fast enough to help him escape from difficult situations, such as juggles, edgeguards, and ledgetraps. His combos and juggles are nevertheless susceptible to DI and easy to dodge thanks to his slow mobility, giving him unusual difficulty in combo game execution than other swordfighters. Corrin's strongest advantage tools, such as his special attacks and forward smash, are afflicted by poor frame data and therefore easy to punish, with forward smash in particular being able to be escaped with SDI. His strongest KO tools additionally require precision due to their small sweetspots, and his grab game is only serviceable, with most of them only used for positional advantage and only one of them being a very late KO throw (up throw). Finally, Corrin is susceptible to gimps and edgeguards: while Dragon Ascent is fast and has a wide hitbox, it is Corrin's only recovery option out of back aerial or situational wall pins with Dragon Lunge, making his recovery linear. Overall, Corrin is a unique swordfighter that excels in a formidable combo game that is reliable across the cast, great edgeguarding and spacing tools, along with many ways to keep his opponent guessing once he is in advantage. However, his lack of defensive options and slow mobility hold his strengths back and means he has to carefully win neutral to avoid his lacking disadvantage state. Opinions on Corrin have been very volatile: he saw the worst representation in the 2019-2020 metagame (with his 2020 representation being tied with Mii Brawler for the lowest) and low opinions due to players perceiving his nerfs as too harsh, especially in the new game engine. However, significant buffs from game updates and the changes to the metagame made his representation greatly improve, especially following the online metagame thanks to the meta becoming punish-heavy and neutral-focused, which favors Corrin's gameplan. As a result, he has seen strong major and supermajor results from players such as Neo and SHADIC, and is considered one of Ultimate's ""late-meta"" picks.","Corrin is a middleweight swordfighter (same as Mario and Dr. Mario), having an above-average height, above-average walking speed, below-average running speed, a below-average initial dash, high traction (having the 10th highest traction), below-average air speed and acceleration (among the bottom 15 in this particular area), and an average falling speed along with a slightly above average gravity. All of these attributes collectively make his mobility fall more along the side of below-average. However, Corrin also possesses the fastest dash to shield speed in the game (at 8 frames, tying with Sheik), which significantly aids in his ability to approach and dealing with projectiles.","Being a swordfighter, Corrin has the innate benefit of having the vast majority of his moves be disjoints, giving him a respectable neutral game with his spacing capabilities as well as his fast frame data, as all of his standard moves except for six (those being dash attack, back air, down air, and all of his smash attacks) come out at frame 9 or faster. Corrin's grounded moveset has good utility; the rapid jab can act as a good damage-racking option while the gentleman jab has its use as a later kill option, killing middleweights at at around 150% at the edge of Final Destination, and forward tilt is a useful spacing tool and kill option that kills middleweights at around 130% on Final Destination. In addition, up tilt and down tilt both serve as combo starters, with down tilt being able to lead into up tilt at mid percents and both tilts being able to combo into aerials such as neutral, forward, and up aerial. Dash attack, while only having slight combo potential and no kill potential, has some notable use for catching landings due to its decent amount of active frames. His smash attacks also have good utility; up smash, while having a weaker grounded hitbox, possesses a strong sweet-spot on the tip that makes it a kill option against opponents in the air, as an uncharged sweet-spot hit can kill as early as 90% against middleweights, and down smash, while being the least useful for killing, at least covers Corrin on both sides. However, his strongest smash attack by far is forward smash; not only can it be angled, but it also boasts incredible range and can kill middleweights as early as 80% near the edges of Final Destination if the tip of the move connects, making it a deadly spacing tool that rewards precision. After the 8.0.0 update, the tipper hitbox is generally safe on shield, making it a decently safe kill option if used well. In addition, the move also has a close hitbox when the move is being charged, which can have its applications in shield pressure and can score some surprise kills. Finally, his grab game, while being among the least useful aspects of his moveset, still has a degree of utility, as up throw can kill middleweights at 160% and above, earlier with rage. His other throws are surprisingly useful in giving him positional advantage. Corrin's air game is also very potent, further supplementing his combo game and advantage state while also sporting other forms of utility; a falling neutral aerial can combo into itself, forward aerial, up aerial, and up tilt at the low and mid percents, with forward aerial boasting similar combo potential. Additionally, its fast start up and good coverage make it a useful out of shield option as well as a potential combo breaker. Up aerial is Corrin's ideal juggling tool that can kill middleweights very early (below 80%) near the top blast zone while also comboing into moves such as back aerial when fast falled and reversed at mid percents. Back aerial is Corrin's strongest aerial, having strong range and kill power, being able to kill middleweights at as early as 80% from the edge of Final Destination, while also having applications as a slight horizontal recovery tool due to the forward push that happens upon using the move. Finally, down air is a stall and fall move that can rack up damage and serve as a landing option, and it can also steal stocks off-stage. Corrin's special moves are quite unique and have mixed utility; Dragon Fang Shot is a chargeable projectile that inflicts stun and possesses a bite follow up attack that serves as situational kill option, and can have its applications as a surprise move to B-reverse with. Dragon Lunge is a skewer attack that can pin opponents in place and be followed up with either a jump or a vaulting kick, with the latter being able to kill middleweights at 105% near the edge of FD; the move also has some edgeguarding utility since the skewer can also be pinned on walls. Dragon Ascent is his primary recovery tool that has decent distance, a hitbox, and intangibility on frames 7-17. Finally, Counter Surge is a counter move that has decent vertical kill power. All of these strengths establish Corrin as a character who excels at range and spacing in the neutral with his attacks while also boasting a solid advantage state with his damage racking and juggling abilities thanks to fast and ranged tilts and aerials. In addition, his special moves also give him some other unique forms of utility in the form of projectiles and ranged kill options.","However, Corrin also has notable weaknesses, one of which is his below average speed. Corrin slightly struggles to keep up with fast opponents and utilize his large disjoints due to low air acceleration and airspeed. Another one of Corrin's most notable flaws is his below average disadvantage. Due to Corrin's slow airspeed and acceleration, he doesn't have many options for mixing up his momentum in the air with the exception of B-reversing. His disadvantage is made more problematic due to the fact that while neutral aerial can sometimes be a decent combo breaker, his only other landing options (down aerial and Counter Surge) are committal and laggy, and can result in getting deeper in disadvantage if these options are used too hastily. His slow air mobility not only hinders his disadvantage but also his recovery, as while Dragon Ascent has decent distance, its usefulness can be greatly hindered if Corrin is launched too far offstage without a jump, though at least that issue can somewhat be circumvented with the horizontal push of back aerial. However, even with this other slight recovery option, as well as the fact that his up special has a hitbox and some intangibility, it doesn't change the fact that Corrin's recovery is fairly linear, making him susceptible to losing stocks at earlier percents with well-placed edge guards against some characters. Another issue with Corrin is his below-average grab game, as the up throw is the only throw with some utility for being a late kill throw. Meanwhile, forward throw and back throw are purely positional throws, which have their uses but do not lead to guaranteed combos, and down throw is solely a high damage option, with none of these other throws having any degree of combo potential or reasonable kill power.","Overall, Corrin is a character who can stand his ground up close and rack up damage efficiently with his spacing tools and his combo and advantage potential, but Corrin's below average speed holds him back from becoming a top tier threat. Corrin's tall frame and moderate gravity make him susceptible to aerial combos and juggling, similar to other fighters from Fire Emblem, although his down aerial can prevent some juggles. Although his flaws are somewhat polarizing due to his slightly exploitable recovery and poor disadvantage, players feel that those flaws can be made up for with his stable combo game and kill confirms as well as his greater raw kill power and range."
Lucina,5,7.366,"Lucina is ranked 28th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her in the A- tier. This is a slight drop from her placement in Smash 4 where she was ranked 14th out of 54, and places her above her base fighter, Marth.","Being Marth's distant descendant and his Echo Fighter, Lucina's moveset and animations are generally based off of Marth's, and her attributes are also identical to his, being a tall and rather light middleweight with above-average mobility in most aspects; like him, she has the fastest walking speed in the game, a very fast initial dash speed, a decent running speed, a decent jump height, decent air acceleration and an average falling speed; however, her air speed is merely average, and her gravity value is low, the latter of these two values making her feel somewhat floaty in the air.","As in SSB4, the primary difference between Lucina and Marth is that Lucina lacks a tipper, meaning that her sword attacks deal equal damage throughout her blade. While her sword attacks deal more damage and knockback than Marth's weak sourspots, they deal less damage and knockback than his powerful tipper sweetspots. Theoretically, Marth should deal more overall damage when played optimally and can kill earlier, but Lucina can deal consistent damage and kill more reliably without worrying about precise spacing, and her KOing potential is significantly more consistent in comparison, especially at higher percents. Overall, whether a person wants to use Lucina or Marth is based on their playstyle. Marth relies on spacing, more defensive play, and early KOs with his powerful tippers. Lucina can be played more aggressively, and relies on her more effective combos to increase the opponent's damage enough so she can KO the opponent. Marth has the potential to be more rewarding if used correctly, but Lucina's consistent damage and knockback gives her a stronger up-close game, makes her attacks significantly safer on shield and on hit than Marth's sourspotted moves, and gives her better matchups against smaller or faster characters that Marth can have a hard time landing his tippers against, such as Pikachu or Fox. Even without a tipper, Lucina is still extremely effective at spacing nevertheless. She also shares Marth's other strengths, such as his decent mobility, above-average frame data, strong juggling and edgeguarding capabilities, and decent out of shield options. As such, she is considered to be one of the easiest and most versatile characters in the game, even when compared to Marth. Lucina's special moveset also possesses immense utility, and in two cases, more than that of Marth. Shield Breaker can break shields thanks to its high shield damage, even when uncharged, and it is useful for punishing rolls. It also grants some horizontal movement, which is amplified when fully charged, deals additional damage should it directly strike an opponent's head, and deals consistent damage unlike Marth's version. Dancing Blade can be used to punish sidesteps and boasts damage-racking, mix-up, KO and even recovery potential. Unlike Marth's version, the move is easier to properly connect due to its consistent hitboxes. Dolphin Slash has quick startup (coming out on frame 5), provides intangibility during its startup, and is relatively strong upon coming out. These attributes make it Lucina's primary method of recovery, as its speed can make it difficult to intercept, while also making it a decent out of shield option as well. In addition, its power combined with the aerial version's frame 1 intangibility makes it capable of breaking combos, and even stage spiking reckless edgeguarding attempts. Lastly, Counter is a counterattack with a 1.2Ã— damage multiplier that can KO an opponent who uses a sufficiently strong attack, and can also be used to edgeguard many recovery moves with damaging hitboxes.","Despite her strengths and versatility, Lucina is not without flaws, most of them shared with Marth. Perhaps the biggest one is her difficulty in escaping from juggles; her air speed is average at best, her gravity is fairly low, her weight is slightly below-average and her tall hurtbox provides an easy target. Dolphin Slash is her only reliable combo breaker, but as it leaves her helpless, it can inadvertently put her in an even worse position. Also, while Counter can be used defensively, it leaves Lucina extremely vulnerable to punishment should it whiff. Lucina also has little defense against juggling, as her aerials are ineffective at relieving pressure; though her attacks have quick startup and decent range, many of them come with high ending lag, and also suffer from short hitbox durations. Additionally, being a solely sword-based character, her otherwise-excellent neutral game suffers from her lack of a projectile, and she can sometimes struggle against projectile-heavy characters and playstyles; however, her combination of high mobility, good range and decent frame data helps to alleviate this issue. Like with Marth, Lucina's lackluster grab game is another notable weakness. Except for her up throw, all of her throws have low knockback scaling, preventing them from KOing at realistic percents, while up throw can only KO starting at extremely high percents if Lucina has no rage. Her only other throw with utility is her down throw, which has limited combo potential outside of lower percents due to its high base knockback. However, it should be noted that the high base knockback of her forward and back throws allow Lucina to take advantage of her good edgeguarding capability, especially at the edge. Lucina herself is somewhat vulnerable to edgeguarding, though she has options for mix-ups with her recovery. Dolphin Slash is her only reliable vertical recovery option, and while it is still a threat to edgeguarders due to its speed, frame 1 intangibility and high stage spike ability, its path is linear and its distance fixed, making it fairly predictable. Additionally, since this move grants little horizontal distance, Lucina is vulnerable to semi-spikes. While Shield Breaker can aid her horizontal recovery, it covers little distance without charging and does not halt her vertical momentum either. Lucina is also heavily reliant on her double jump and directional air dodge for mix-ups in her recovery, and is in significant danger if offstage without either of them.","Overall, Lucina is a ""lower-risk, higher-reward"" version of Marth, and her strengths outweigh her weaknesses. She trades Marth's stronger KO potential courtesy of his stronger but notoriously inconsistent tippers for more consistent spacing and damage-racking abilities, better close-range capabilities, as well as more consistent KO potential. She has a low learning curve thanks to her straightforward playstyle, since she benefits from spacing at close range while also having several fast and reliably strong KOing options, however this linear playstyle can also hurt her as players will ultimately have a better time fighting her once they learned the matchup."
Terry,5,7.324,"Terry is ranked 29th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the A- tier. Terry's strengths revolve around his combo ability and deadly KO setups. His normals are all effective for racking up damage, as his tilts and some of his aerials can be auto-cancelled into his specials, while his auto-turnaround ability also allows him to punish rolls and create deadly ledgetraps. In addition, Terry's combo and KO ability is further enhanced when Terry is past 100%, as it activates his ""GO!"" meter, granting him access to his ""Super Specials"" that can lead into relatively early KOs in the right situation; he is able to utilize to GO! meter effectively thanks to being a heavyweight, allowing him to survive up to higher percents. All of this makes Terry rather dangerous when fighting him up close and at higher percents. However, Terry does have several weaknesses. Terry's strengths rely on other characters approaching him, and he has more trouble fighting characters from afar. His disadvantage state is below average since he has trouble landing, while his tall frame and stature makes him susceptible to juggling. His recovery is also exploitable if one knows how to play around it, making him rather vulnerable offstage. Finally, his normals can be escaped with good SDI allowing for most of Terry's combos to be unreliable, forcing Terry to switch up his gameplan once other players know how to deal with his combos. Overall, Terry's strengths outweigh his weaknesses. Although he has a smaller playerbase compared to other high-tier characters, he has nonetheless garnered strong results from players such as AndresFn and Riddles.","Terry is a tall, heavyweight fighter who weighs the same as Samus, Dark Samus, and Bowser Jr. Due to hailing from a traditional fighting game series, Terry always faces his opponent in 1-on-1 matches, a trait that he shares with Ryu, Ken, and Kazuya. While this makes it more difficult for him to utilize his powerful back aerial, it more importantly makes his command inputs easier to execute and less likely to misinput, and allows him to punish rolls and cross ups more easily than the vast majority of the cast. He has slow air speed, a very slow initial dash, and decent dashing speed, but is characterized most by his great ground game. This includes a potent backward dash (which allows Terry to play footsies very effectively), a strong set of normal moves and special moves, his unique ability to attack directly out of a spot dodge, and his comeback mechanic which allows incredibly powerful Super Special Moves that require specific input combinations to use.","Terry's playstyle capitalizes on his strong bait-and-punish options. Terry has good tools, sporting many finishing moves in his smash attacks, clean dash attack, clean back aerial, sweetspotted down aerial, and the majority of his special moves. Forward tilt sports good range and above-average damage, while also granting Terry's leg intangibility. Dash attack has respectable power and traveling distance, the latter of which extends to its ability to cross up shields. Forward smash deals very high damage and knockback with impressive horizontal range to boot. Up smash has good vertical range and also deals high damage and knockback. Down smash has good range and high speed, but is still decently strong. Back aerial deals high damage and knockback when clean, and sports excellent range overall. Lastly, down aerial is Terry's most damaging aerial, and can meteor smash opponents when sweetspotted. Like Ryu, Ken, and Kazuya, Terry's special moves have special inputs that grant them more power and capabilities. These are generally dictated by how long the player holds the special button and normally determine distance and strength. His neutral special, Power Wave, is a projectile that travels on ground and serves as a good long-range poke that has both a weak and strong version, with the latter having a faster travel distance. In mid-air, it instead turns into a mid-range poking tool that deals more knockback, while also temporarily suspending Terry in the air. All of Terry's other moves come in four different variations when accounting for their weak/strong regular input variations and their weak/strong command input variations. Burning Knuckle (â†“ â†˜ â†’ + attack/special) is one of Terry's go-to KO options, as even the weak regular input can KO opponents at reasonable percents. In addition to its KO potential, it is Terry's best tech-chasing tool. Terry is also the first character to sport a ""backward special"" in the form of Crack Shoot (â†“ â†™ â† + attack/special). While it is not a KO move, it high-profiles through certain low attacks and has a wide enough hitbox that it serves as both a reliable anti-air and Terry's most reliable cross up option at point-blank range. Rising Tackle (c.â†“ â†‘ + attack/special) sports intangibility on Terry's legs, and its command input version sports full body invincibility, making it an effective anti-air. Finally, Power Dunk (â†’ â†“ â†˜ + attack/special) serves as a strong combo ender with invincibility on startup, and is another one of Terry's most reliable KO moves. The command version has a meteor hitbox, though connecting this hitbox is difficult, as it is only active during the descending portion. One of Terry's biggest strengths is his punish game. Due to his ability to cancel some moves into specials, such as his jab, neutral aerial, and down aerial, Terry can successfully deal a large amount of damage from any opening, and due to his unique ability of always facing his opponent in 1v1 battles, this grants him very strong ledgetrapping potential. The aforementioned Power Dunk is among the most notable, as Terry can cancel into it from even his jab, and KO opponents with relative ease. Additionally, Terry has a comeback mechanic in the form of two Super Special Moves: Power Geyser (â†“ â†™ â† â†™ â†’ + attack/special or â†“ â† â†“ â†’ + attack/special) and Buster Wolf (â†“ â†˜ â†’ â†“ â†˜ â†’ + attack/special or â†“ â†’ â†“ â†’ + attack/special). Power Geyser is an enormous geyser of energy that is released from the ground directly in front of Terry. It boasts incredible height and damage; this not only makes it an excellent KO option, but also an extremely effective anti-air move, as well as a very potent threat to shields. Buster Wolf causes Terry to dash forward a fair distance (roughly half the length of Final Destination) in order to throw a punch that functions as a hit command grab, similarly to Fishing Rod. If the punch hits, he immediately generates an explosive, highly damaging blast of energy from his fist that can KO extremely early. As these moves are only accessible when Terry is at or above 100% in Stock or Time Battles (or his hit points are 30% or lower in Stamina Mode) their effective power is further increased slightly by rage. However, while Terry is able to use these attacks any amount of times when passed the percentage threshold, their considerable ending lag makes them very punishable if blocked or whiffed. Although he is known for being a punishing character with a plethora of KO moves, set-ups, and confirms, Terry also has a good combo game. Neutral attack can easily chain into itself or special cancel to deal high amounts of damage. Up tilt boasts both high speed and damage, has good range, can be special canceled, and is reliable for juggles. Down tilt deals extremely low damage and knockback while having very low all-around lag, making it a fairly spammable poke and useful combo starter, even being able to set up into KO confirms. Neutral and up aerials both provide plentiful combo opportunities, due to their mixture of low overall lag, good range, and decent damage outputs and knockback. Despite his poor air speed, Terry's neutral aerial can combo into itself with ease, to the point that it can perform a Wall of Pain which can then be easily followed up with his down aerial's meteor smash hitbox.","In spite of his strengths, Terry still has notable drawbacks. His overall disadvantage state is a glaring weakness: Terry's fall speed is among the lower half of the cast, and when combined with his tall hurtbox, he is noticeably susceptible to juggles. Rising Tackle, while having intangibility throughout the first half of the move, is unable to sweetspot the edge, meaning that Terry is forced to utilize it from very low under the stage, as he is otherwise left vulnerable for a hard punish at the move's apex. Additionally, the move's vertical and horizontal distance is sub-par, making it a generally inferior recovery move. Terry's aerial speed is also well below-average, making his off-stage endurance lacking. While he is able to mix up his recovery to a certain extent with his specials, he is unlikely to survive in most off-stage situations if he has exhausted his double jump and side special. Despite having a strong grounded neutral game, it is largely centered around baiting the opponent to approach and reading their habits to lead into combo extensions. As such, Terry doesn't possess many good pokes outside of down tilt. Given his average ground speed and poor air speed, Terry's aerial approaches are fairly weak unless he starts close to his target. Though Terry's inputs are a bit more lenient in comparison to the other traditional fighting game characters, it can nonetheless take time to master his inputs to their full potential, giving him a relatively high learning curve overall. The Super Special Moves are of particular note: they are accessible only when his damage is at 100% or his hit points are 30% or lower in Stamina Mode, and they both have considerable ending lag to compensate for their astounding power. As a result, Terry's playstyle can change drastically when the Super Specials comes into play. Improper inputs can also result in failing to perform what would otherwise be a KO confirm (such as with Power Dunk), or even an unintentional self-destruct (such as with Burning Knuckle/Crack Shoot). As such, it is crucial to get the hang of inputting moves correctly and at the right time in order to avoid inadvertently putting Terry in a very disadvantageous situation.","Overall, Terry is a melee-focused and ""footsies""-oriented heavyweight character with immense combo, damage, and KO options in all areas. His ability to apply dangerous shield pressure or cross-up shielding opponents is incredibly useful when executed at the right times. The Super Special Moves can also give Terry the mental edge over opponents, as any ill-managed approach on the opponent's end can be called out by extremely hard punishes. Due to being a heavyweight he is very hard to KO without a proper edge-guard, making him more dangerous the longer he holds onto his stock. However, his poor disadvantage state and mediocre off-stage endurance means players need to be mindful of every off-stage option, as Terry can be KO'd easily to an off-stage gimp, and despite his powerful neutral, many of his most effective moves leave him vulnerable, meaning the player must make calculated decisions with which attacks to throw out in pressure situations."
Zero Suit Samus,5,7.302,"Zero Suit Samus is currently ranked 30th out of 82 characters on the current Ultimate tier list, placing her at the bottom of the A- tier. This is a significant drop from her top-tier position in Smash 4, where she was ranked 6th out of 54 characters, and is her worst placement in the series to date. Zero Suit Samus possesses fantastic movement that allows her to be fantastic as a hit-and-run character and even a time-out character, while also giving her a strong disadvantage state. Zero Suit Samus also possesses a long and fast recovery thanks to Flip Jump, Boost Kick, and her tether. She also possesses safe aerials and a projectile that complements her strong neutral game and grants her a strong aerial game. However, Zero Suit Samus also has some notable weaknesses. Zero Suit Samus has issues closing out stocks consistently and her damage racking capabilities are unimpressive compared to other top-tier characters, making her ability to make comebacks rather poor. She also has weak survivability due to being a tall yet light character, making her susceptible to early KOs. Finally, she has little out-of-shield options, while the options she does have are either inconsistent or has average startup. Zero Suit Samus was initially considered to be among the best characters in the game and had strong representation thanks to Marss and many players in Japan, including Choco and Kuro. However, nerfs to her strengths, buffs to other characters, metagame shifts due to the addition of DLC characters, and a lack of activity from her best players led to a noticeable decline following the online era.","Zero Suit Samus is a tall, lightweight character, similar to Zelda and Rosalina, which alongside her low weight (tied with Meta Knight for the seventh lowest) gives her poor endurance. However, much like other rushdown characters of her playstyle, her mobility is among the best in the game; she possesses the 2nd fastest initial dash in the game, the 7th fastest run speed, the 9th fastest air speed, the 15th fastest air acceleration, and the 3rd highest jump height overall. Altogether, this combination of traits gives her an excellent hit-and-run playstyle.","One of her biggest strengths is her outstanding air game, considered among the best in the cast. While her neutral aerial has noticeable start-up, it is decently disjointed and sends at an excellent angle for combos. This makes it one of her main tools in the neutral and is notable for having several KO confirms into some of her finishing moves. Her forward aerial is also a great combo starter due to its low lag and can be useful for edgeguarding, while it also has some KO potential offstage. Her back aerial is fast, fairly strong, and can be combo'd into from a neutral aerial at high percents, making it one of her primary KO options. Her up aerial is exceptionally fast at frame 6 and can be combo'd into itself repeatedly, making it a great juggling tool that can sometimes KO confirm into Boost Kick. Her down aerial is a stall-then-fall aerial with a meteor smash hitbox; while it is her slowest aerial and easily her most unsafe, it can nonetheless be used as a situational KO move and landing option. Finally, she is one of the only characters in the game with a grab aerial, which like most other grab aerials has long range and low lag overall, giving her a good approach against aerial foes as well as a niche recovery option. While her ground game isn't as powerful as her aerials, it still has decent utility. Her neutral attack is notable for coming out instantly on frame 1, making it a reliable anti-pressure tool despite its poor damage output and range. Her forward tilt has good range, low lag, and can set up tech-chase situations and can trip at low percents when angled downwards, her up tilt is the fastest of its kind at 3 frames of startup and can be used as an anti-air, and her down tilt lowers her hurtbox and is useful as a ranged poking option while also being a decent combo starter. Her down smash has decently sized hitboxes with low ending lag and is an effective combo tool starting from lower percentages while at higher percentages, it can lead into KO moves such as Boost Kick or up smash; however, unlike most other down smashes, it only hits in front of her, limiting its utility for tech-chasing. Lastly, her up smash has impressive vertical range overall, deals high hitstun, has low enough ending lag for combos at low percentages, and has decent KO power, arguably making it one of the best up smashes in Ultimate. Zero Suit Samus also has a decent grab game, as her grab has a very long range, while all of her throws deal at least 8% damage. Her forward throw can be used for tech chasing, while her back throw can force opponents into unfavorable offstage situations or even lead into her infamous Flip Jump meteor smash. Her up throw is a decent KO throw (which KO's starting around 170%), and while her down throw is ironically unsuitable for combos unlike other down throws, it can still follow up at low percentages if the opponent fails to act fast enough. Finally, her special moveset has strong utility overall. Paralyzer, her neutral special, has a very fast charge time compared to other chargeable projectiles, and starting at mid percentages, will stun opponents long enough for her to be able to follow up. Plasma Whip, her side special, is a long-ranged attack with very strong utility: tapping the button will cause the move to become a multi-hitting KO option that KO's starting at 140% if fresh, while holding the button will cause the move to hit once and knock foes upward. While this version is less suited for offense and has more lag, it still has utility for setting up combos. Boost Kick, her up special, travels merely average distance as a recovery, but compensates with having many options that follow up into it (such as neutral and up aerials, Paralyzer and Flip Jump's burying sweetspot), while the last hit is strong enough to KO earlier than her forward smash and her strongest move overall. Finally, her down special, Flip Jump, is a 45Â° acrobatic jump that does not render her helpless in the air, while its followup kick can meteor smash foes in the air or bury them on the ground, and is fast enough that it will often leave slower characters (such as Ganondorf) in dangerous situations. It also grants intangibility on frames 3-12, making it an excellent tool for getting out of disadvantage.","Zero Suit Samus is not without flaws, however. Perhaps her most infamous flaw lies in her defense: while her recovery is among the most effective in Ultimate due to her abundance of recovery options, fast air speed, and high jumps, her aforementioned weight and tall frame give her very poor endurance, while her recovery options (except for Flip Jump) are linear and fairly straightforward to edgeguard, which can make her recovery predictable. This flaw is further stressed with her fast falling speed, as it is easy for characters with sufficiently fast combo attacks (including Mario and Pichu) to perform combos on her (although her frame 2 air dodges can somewhat alleviate this issue). Her ground game, despite its strengths, is also flawed. While her tilts have passable range, and her up and down smashes are good for followups and KO confirms, her forward smash has high end lag for an attack of its kind and is not strong or consistent enough to KO reliably, making it arguably her worst move. Her dash attack cannot reliably combo due to its high ending lag, and her down smash, despite its followup potential, is unsafe on hit at low percentages due to its low hitlag and knockback, meaning that the paralyzed opponent(s) can generally act before she can follow up. Zero Suit Samus's out-of-shield game can also be rather problematic. While Boost Kick is very fast at frame 6 and can KO very early at the ledge, it lacks sufficient range in front of her and has a very hard time punishing cross-ups out of shield. While the aerial version has more range, it also costs 3 extra frames to start up (due to her jumpsquat) and as such is less reliable. Her up smash acts as a solid out of shield option due to its decent horizontal range but is still merely frame 10, which while fast for an up smash, is only average startup for an out of shield option. Her rather high short hop also causes her aerials to be unviable out of shield outside of forward aerial on certain characters, and her grab by default is very slow. As such, ZSS's out of shield game suffers immensely if the opponent spaces against her shield well. Finally, while her grab game has some utility, it is still notably flawed. As her throws only deal passable damage at best, while up throw is her only KO throw (and not a particularly potent one at that), they are only generally used to deal damage if other close-range moves are stale. Her grab in general is also very laggy in startup and end lag, meaning that despite its long range, it is easy to punish from any sufficiently fast attack if it misses. Lastly, the nerfs to her down throw, which was easily her best throw from Smash 4, make her grab game more suited for direct offense instead of damage racking strings, giving it limited utility overall.","In the end, Zero Suit Samus retains much of her playstyle from Smash 4, being a hit-and-run character with a strong punish game, while the transition from Smash 4 to Ultimate has improved her overall mobility and neutral tools at the cost of her potent ladder combos and overall KO power."
Sheik,6,7.115,"Sheik is currently ranked 31st out of 82 characters placing her in B+ tier. This is a large drop from her top tier placement in Super Smash Bros. 4, where she was ranked 4th out of 54. Sheik's main strength is her unrivaled frame data, with most of her attacks coming out at no later than frame 4 or 5. They also have very little end lag, enabling maximum reliability for most of her moves and combos to connect and safety on shield. This frame data also grants her arguably the best neutral game, a strong edgeguarding game, highly effective special attacks, and one of the best advantage states of any character. Complementing her neutral game is one of the best neutral specials in the game in Needle Storm, which is useful not only for zoning, camping, or connecting combos, but also confirms into offstage KOs with Bouncing Fish. Furthermore, she boasts a powerful and flexible recovery, with Vanish and Bouncing Fish giving her extensive range and distance that can reliably bring her back to the stage, as well as being fast and reliable KO options.

However, Sheik has significant weaknesses, the most prominent being her poor endurance. She is the sixth lightest character in the game, and her high falling speed and gravity makes her prone to easy combos and early KOs. Her grab game is also below-average; while down throw is a reliable combo starter at low percents, its utility drops off quickly, with its KO confirms requiring Sheik to read the opponent's DI or else only working at very specific percentages. Furthermore, Sheik's otherwise amazing neutral and combo game is sometimes offset by the very low damage output from her attacks, so she must win neutral multiple times to be able to inflict the same amount of damage that many other fighters can rack up from a single interaction or combo. Finally, Sheik's KO ability is generally subpar; while the handful of KO options she does possess have quick frame data and are mostly safe on shield, they are burdened with either awkward hitboxes or the requirement of a platform extension or prior combo string. For example, down smash works as an out of shield option but is sometimes inconsistent and only KOs at much higher percents, while up smash is afflicted by a large sourspot, and it often requires a combo and/or platform extension to KO reliably. Another KO option, Bouncing Fish, has high end lag, so it is somewhat unreliable in neutral for a KO and often requires either a combo string, or an offstage kill setup. Finally, rage alleviates her subpar KO abilities to a considerable degree; however, she struggles to survive long enough to benefit from it, especially against heavyweights, who can possibly live up to very high percents and KO her with rage of their own.

Overall, Sheik is a character with powerful unique abilities and attributes. She has a somewhat high learning curve, so her combo and KO abilities depend on the player putting in consistent time and effort to perform effectively. The general consensus on her was mostly poor in the early metagame, with players particularly highlighting the excessive nerfs she received transitioning into Ultimate. However, significant buffs from patch updates have since put the character's perception in a better shape, especially during the post-pandemic metagame. The consensus right now is that she is a high effort-high reward character that is only viable after one has significantly mastered her capabilities. Sheik remains a viable character in the current metagame, proven by players such as WebbJP, Eim, Mr.R, and VoiD.","Sheik is a character that, like a ninja of sorts, fits the ""hit-and-run"" character archetype. One of Sheik's greatest strengths is her overall mobility, being among the best in the game both grounded and aerial. She also has the 4th highest gravity, which makes her mobility better, but leaves her more vulnerable to horizontal knockback. Her crouch is also very low, making her difficult to hit when doing so. Sheik can also wall cling and crawl. However, she is the 6th-lightest character in the game, which when coupled with her gravity and tall height, these traits collectively make her very susceptible to combos and KO's, thus giving her very frail survivability overall.","Aside from her excellent mobility, another one of Sheik's greatest strengths is her extremely quick frame data. Easily one of if not the fastest in the game. With all of her moves with the exception of her down aerial and smash attacks coming out under 6 frames and all having very minimal ending lag, making her extremely difficult to punish properly; this is supplemented by the good range of her moveset. She also has an excellent projectile in Needle Storm, with the needles charging and traveling fast, being long-ranged (covers about half of Final Destination), possessing transcendent priority, causing hitstun, and having overall low cool down (especially when used in the air or on landing). These traits collectively give Sheik a strong camping ability and as well as allowing for versatile follow-ups off of her needles.

Overall, the combination of Sheik's mobility, projectiles, range and frame data form her greatest strength: her outstanding neutral game. She can play both defensively, by pressuring and zoning from afar without much trouble, or aggressively, with her fast attack speed giving her an unpredictable approach. Sheik can poke and pressure her opponents with her aerials and tilts, all of which are safe options. If they choose to drop their shield, they are wide open to these attacks. At the same time, holding shield presents her with an opportunity to grab and use her throw set-ups.

Sheik's excellent frame data, combined with the low power of many of her moves, give her among the best combo abilities in the game. Her throws can easily lead to other attacks, with her forward and down throws being particularly effective at starting combos, as they can set up long chains of forward aerials, with her up aerial and Bouncing Fish being useful combo finishers. Her combos are not limited to her air game; all of her tilts can start and extend combos since they send opponents into the air, and can confirm into aerials; her forward tilt particularly has reliable follow-ups all the way into KO percents. Down tilt, while not chaining into itself as effectively, has even lower power, giving her access to KO confirms as well.

All aspects of Sheik's moveset are solid overall. The majority of her aerial moves possess great versatility; forward aerial, in particular, has a fast startup, decent ending lag, auto-cancels in a short hop fast fall, and has slightly disjointed range, making it an all-purpose move: it can be used to approach, pressure, combo and set up edge-guards. Up aerial similarly possesses great utility: its looping hits can be used to drag down opponents to extend combos or lead into KOs depending on positioning, much like Joker's own up aerial. Additionally, it is her strongest aerial, and also launches opponents at a great angle for juggling, both of which give it good utility at both KOing and finishing combos. Her back aerial is also versatile to an extent, as it can be used to extend or finish combos as well. When sweet spotted (at the foot), it can KO at high percents near the ledge and is even safer on shield than her forward aerial. Lastly, neutral aerial is her fastest aerial, allowing her to break out of combos and extend or finish hers, notably into Bouncing Fish.

Outside of Needle Storm, Sheik's special moveset also possesses good utility. Her up special, Vanish, grants her intangibility and invisibility, which collectively make it difficult for the opponent to predict where she will reappear. It also has a hitbox on disappearance that is moderately strong, and another one and a windbox when she reappears, making it difficult to punish. Meanwhile, Sheik's down special Bouncing Fish, is famous for being her primary KO move, being similar to Flip Jump on some regards: it deals respectable damage with high knockback scaling, can finish combos from her neutral aerial, forward aerial, back aerial, and aerial Needle Storm, and is safe on shield when retreating. Sheik can perform consecutive stronger kicks after the first, although this sees almost no use in normal gameplay.

Both Vanish and Bouncing Fish also conform Sheik's last strength in her recovery, as they make it versatile and extendable, both of them can be used in tandem with each other, and they are difficult and risky to intercept, as they both deal high knockback enough to interrupt an edge-guard. Combined with her wall jump, this makes Sheik hard to edge-guard or gimp, without disabling her double jump, and enables her to reverse edge-guard effectively.","However, despite having immense strengths, Sheik has polarizing flaws. The most notable of them is her frailty: despite the fact that her recovery is amazing, in a similar vein to Fox, her on-stage endurance is very weak due to her very lightweight (being lighter than characters such as Kirby), succumbing to even decently strong blows, whereas her above average height, high falling speed and gravity make her easy to combo. This is further compounded by her notoriously poor damage output overall: despite her strong damage racking ability, she requires extremely long strings of attacks just to do the same amount of damage that the vast majority of the cast can inflict in noticeably far fewer hits, making her arguably the weakest fighter in the game in terms of general damage and knockback in her moveset.

While the low damage and power on her moves grant her an extensive combo game, Sheik also struggles to securely score KOs due to her handful of KO options and each of them being difficult to land precisely. Her up smash has a powerful first hit on her arms as she raises them, but it is difficult to land outside of a read or confirm, is hampered by its much weaker second hit as she lowers her arms and is very punishable if missed, her forward and down smash are among the weakest smash attacks of their kind, and they have punishable ending lag as well, while Vanish's disappearing hitbox is hard to land. In the air, she is limited to using her up aerial, back aerial, or Bouncing Fish to KO, and even then, the former two require to be used close to the blast lines due to their relatively weak knockback, whereas the latter is susceptible to DI and is predictable without a setup on top of KOing considerably later center-stage compared to the edge, making her often reliant on dragging her opponent close to the blast zone in order to secure a KO.

Furthermore, Sheik's aerial KO setups are difficult to pull off due to Ultimate's faster pace and launch physics, re-addition of directional air dodges, and the weakening of her neutral and back aerials' respective combo potentials. Her other aerials are otherwise only useful for edge-guarding and gimping characters with particularly weak or linear recoveries due to their abysmal KO power or sacrificial use. Sheik's grab game is also below-average overall: she lacks throws that can KO at realistic percents, and while her aforementioned forward and down throws are useful combo starters, they have too much knockback for truly reliable KO set-ups.

With all of these weaknesses working against her, it is not uncommon for Sheik's opponents to survive in excess of 150%. When combined with her frailty, she is notoriously vulnerable to comebacks, even against fighters with generally mediocre KO potentials. Lastly, the rage mechanic hinders Sheik: without rage, she often has trouble KO'ing, though as her rage increases, her combo game slowly dwindles, which when combined with her poor damage output, can make bringing an opponent to KO percents difficult. Additionally, this brings opponents to a high level of rage enough to KO Sheik herself.

Other weaknesses include a few moves that have very low utility, despite Sheik's moveset versatility. These include her down aerial, which is her overall slowest aerial, has the highest landing lag and is a stall-then-fall, giving it the lowest utility of Sheik's aerial moveset despite it meteor smashing an opponent. Her dash attack, although very quick, is unsafe on shield due to its inability to cross-up and does not KO at realistic percents. Her up throw similarly does not KO at realistic percents and is her least useful throw, as it lacks the utility her other throws have. Sheik's smash attacks are unsafe and difficult to land overall, although they are fast enough to work as combo finishers. Lastly, Burst Grenade is powerful but has a slow explosion, which limits it to situational usage on edge-guarding predictable recoveries, extending the damage of a hard punish, or a situational mix-up to deter edge-guarders.","Altogether, Sheik's strengths slightly outweigh her weaknesses. While she has an outstanding neutral game owing to her excellent frame data and mobility, she often has to play a very long game due to her slow damage output. At that point, Sheik has to play an entirely different playstyle and try to look for openings to land her KO confirms. Nevertheless, Sheik's strengths and the myriad of buffs she received from game updates have resulted in many top players having an overall positive view on her viability, especially compared to the early meta when she was commonly considered a low-tier character."
Ryu ,6,6.981,"Ryu is ranked 32nd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B+ tier. This is a noticeable drop from his 11th/12th out of 54 placement in SSB4 where he was tied with Marth. Ryu has a strong combo game due to his auto turn around mechanic and ability to special cancel out of several of his moves. His multitude of combos gives him a strong advantage state and high damage output. His Hadouken (the Shakunetsu, in particular) is well-known for playing his neutral and suits his defensive playstyle. The rest of his specials all serve use as they are single hit moves that are good for KOs and combo finishers.

Despite these strengths, Ryu has some weaknesses. His mobility is subpar so his approach options are limited and it forces him to play more defensively. His recovery is also exploitable and linear with Tatsumaki Senpukyaku and Shoryuken traveling predictable distances for the opponent to edgeguard. Despite having a combo breaker in the form of Focus Attack, it can be broken through multi-hit moves making his disadvantage state below average. Ryu is also a difficult character to master due to his different playstyle with the special cancel and auto turnaround mechanic.

Ryu has seen some representation and strong results from players, such as Asimo and Ikan, doing well with him at majors and supermajors.","As the ""all-rounder"" of his home series, Ryu's overall attributes are mostly average. As a heavyweight with average mobility, Ryu has decent frame data and damage output, as well as a dependable ground game due to his decent traction and average dashing speed. However, his other attributes are polarized in an attempt to replicate the physics of Street Fighter. Ryu's walking speed is extremely slow, and while his air speed is slightly above-average, this is counteracted by his moderately high falling speed and extremely short jumps. Additionally, he has the 2nd-slowest air acceleration and his air friction is uniquely locked at 0 while jumping or double jumping, causing his jumps to follow a fixed ""arc"" unless the player steers them manually. Finally, Ryu's fast fall increases his falling speed by 40% instead of the usual 60%. Overall, this grants Ryu effective burst movement through dashing and jumping, but forces him to commit when approaching through the air and makes it difficult to land or move short distances.","Despite his average attributes, Ryu is one of the most unique fighters in Ultimate, as he has access to many variations of both his standard and special attacks. His jab and tilts can either be held or tapped; tapped attacks are faster and usually combo well into themselves, while held attacks have greater KO potential and can serve as combo finishers. This also applies to his special moves (other than Focus Attack), which gain different effects like increased power or altered hitboxes when the button is held; they also see an increase in power when used with the original Street Fighter inputs. This effectively gives Ryu two movesets, one for starting combos and racking up damage, and the other for scoring KOs. This versatility gives him access to potent true combos and mix-ups, leading to a strong punish game overall. His Collarbone Breaker (held forward tilt) deals immense shield damage, further complementing his ability to pressure and deplete shields.

Ryu's grounded moveset boasts considerable utility. His tapped jab and down tilt both hit on frame 3, making the former useful for relieving pressure, and the latter excellent for extending combos due to its launch trajectory being useful for followups, such as grabs. Tapped up tilt's low knockback, high speed and active frames make it effective for combos, either into itself, Shoryuken, or even down aerial at high percents near the ledge. Held down tilt can be canceled on a hit into a special move, making it effective for shield pressure and damage-racking even at high percents. Down smash is quite powerful for its speed, and up smash lowers Ryu's hurtbox while charging. Both tapped forward tilt and held jab are altered at close range, both becoming very potent at starting combos into his special moves. Additionally, Ryu will automatically face his opponent in 1-on-1 matches while standing on the ground, making it considerably easier to land his effective ground attacks.

Ryu's aerial moveset is effective as well. Neutral aerial is a sex kick with low knockback and has only five frames of landing lag, making it useful for combos and kill confirms even at high percents. Forward aerial is quick, highly damaging and has good range; it can be chained into itself through repeated jumps, and its sour spot deals high shield damage. Up aerial has fast startup and decently high reach, making it useful for juggling, and both it and down aerial can auto-cancel from a full hop.

Complementing Ryu's moveset and combo potential is his wide array of powerful finishers; some of his held tilts, smash attacks, and aerials are very capable KO moves due to their high speed. Held up tilt grants upper body intangibility on frames 4-10 while hitting on frame 7, making it deceptively safe for KOs when combined with its speed and tapped up tilt setups. Up smash makes an effective substitute for held up tilt as a finisher, and its wide hitbox can catch aerial approaches. While slow, Ryu's forward smash has long range and is his strongest standard ground attack, making it useful for hard punishes. Back aerial is Ryu's strongest aerial, and is fast and with good range. Forward and up aerial also serve as decent KO moves, enhancing their already impressive utility. Finally, down aerial is a powerful meteor smash with a fast start-up and long duration, making it a deadly edgeguarding tool. Combined with his excellent combo ability, Ryu's punish game is incredibly effective and versatile, being able to rack up damage or KO very easily after connecting with almost any attack.

Ryu's signature special moves are also effective in their own ways. Hadoken is a large ki projectile, with three distinct variations, each with a different travel speed, based on input method; the standard version is capable of locking, while the input and Shakunetsu Hadoken deal more damage (with the latter being a multi-hit flame projectile). Tatsumaki Senpukyaku propels Ryu forward and deals more damage after an initial travel distance, while the 7.0.0 update allows the move to have Ryu travel through certain projectiles and low hits. Ryu's signature Shoryuken serves as his main vertical recovery move, it is most well-known for its offensive utility, due to its sweet spot's high knockback and brief intangibility (frame 5). The input version of Shoryuken has increased KO power, even longer intangibility (frames 4-6, with arm intangibility, frames 1-14), and lower landing lag, and can easily be chained into from Ryu's other moves. Finally, Focus Attack grants Ryu heavy armor against a single hit, and incapacitates opponents when at least half-charged, allowing for followups. It can also be canceled on hit, after tanking a blow, or even while charging, allowing Ryu to fake out with a shuffle that also provides horizontal recovery distance. His close held neutral attack, first two hits of tapped neutral attack, close tapped forward tilt, held down tilt, and all aerials can be canceled into special moves, allowing Ryu to combo into Shoryuken or Tatsumaki for KOs, Hadoken for safety and damage racking, and Focus Attack for mixups and safety.

Lastly, Ryu has a long-distanced recovery and is surprisingly difficult to combo, traits not shared with most heavyweights. Tatsumaki Senpukyaku has large hitboxes and doesn't cause helplessness; this combined with canceled Focus Attack's armor and momentum boost grants surprisingly effective horizontal distance and protection. Shoryuken travels a good vertical distance, reaches above edges, and can stage spike reckless edge guarders. Focus Attack also serves as an effective combo breaker, and neutral aerial and input Shoryuken both grant high speed and intangibility and can even lead into combo or KO opportunities respectively. These traits allow Ryu to survive to very high percents when used effectively, which also allows him to take full advantage of rage.","Despite his abundance of strengths, Ryu has his weaknesses, some of which are exploitable. Despite his aforementioned recovery being very long-distanced overall, it is very short if many extendable elements, such as Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, are not utilized. Focus Attack still requires a brief charge before it can be canceled. Tatsumaki Senpukyaku's long duration makes it susceptible to being interrupted by long-ranged attacks during use, and he can only use it once if airborne without landing back on stage or taking hitstun. Ryu's falling speed, low jumps and very poor air acceleration causes his vertical recovery to suffer if he is constantly forced offstage at lower trajectories, which is exacerbated by Shoryuken's recovery being almost strictly vertical while also having very high aerial lag. As such, while Ryu has a manageable horizontal recovery, his vertical recovery is easy to predict and interrupt. Additionally, while Ryu excels at shield pressure, his grab game is otherwise poor. Although his throws have decent damage output, none of them have effective follow-up or KO potential due to them having too much knockback to combo, and too little to secure stocks. Down throw is his only combo throw, but only at very low percents, while the unique mechanics of his other throws only work in doubles and free-for-alls (down throw instantly breaking shields, and up throw being capable of KOing bystanders).

Ryu's strong combo potential is also held back by his neutral game, with several factors making it difficult for him to find openings. His very slow walking speed hinders the otherwise great utility of his tilt attacks, and his overall range is very short despite his good frame data (especially in regard to his tapped tilts and neutral aerial), giving him trouble with characters who possess disjointed hitboxes, especially when including his tall stature. His only projectile, Hadoken, is very easily telegraphed and punishable due to its sluggishness and lag. Overall, these two issues force him to play patiently and take advantage of any openings, due to his difficulty with contending against opposing camping and inability to force approaches. Despite the advantages granted by Focus Attack, Ryu's aerial approach is comparatively poor due to his fixed arc jumps and poor air acceleration, which forces him to commit with air attacks. Furthermore, the advantages offered by Focus Attack are match-up dependent; it is relatively ineffective against characters with several multiple hitting moves, with some characters being able to exploit it for a free hit. As Focus Attack is also one of Ryu's main methods of escaping combos against such characters, Ryu's high weight and rather quick falling speed leave him susceptible to some combos and juggles, and his slow fast-falling speed gives him occasional difficulty landing.

Notably, Ryu suffers from the inability to ""force"" KOs, as his KO potential relies heavily on stringing his aforementioned combo moves. While Ryu does possess some powerful moves, such as his sweetspotted forward smash and back aerial, those moves mostly require hard reads to land, while most of his other moves have low knockback scaling due to being tailored for combo use. Ryu's great combo ability compensates for this and often makes it less of a necessity for him to KO early; regardless, without the proper use of reads, setups, a heavy knowledge of Ryu's moveset, or a lack of compensating for an opponent's smash directional influence, Ryu can have a difficult time taking stocks from opponents due to his significant lack of moves that can KO without prior combos. Finally, the emphasis of using Ryu's unique button inputs cause his normal specials to have lower power without traditionally inputting them, and it is possible for a simple slip of the hand to use the wrong move at an essential time, most notoriously with him accidentally self-destructing while recovering.","Overall, Ryu is a combo-oriented fighter with a fearsome offensive ability, due to his unique mechanics deliberately giving him the true combos necessary for many characters' competitive success; his ability to overwhelm opponents by trapping them in hitstun/shield pressure, multiple options to negate and escape combos, along with his dependable recovery all tie in to him being very rewarding and unpredictable, with his strengths somewhat outweighing his weaknesses. However, unlike his Echo Fighter, Ken, Ryu is also capable of playing a more zoning-based playstyle, thanks in part to his more damaging Hadoken projectile and his command-input Shakunetsu Hadoken, which is in line with his playstyle in his home series. However, his polarized movement, mediocre vertical recovery, and lack of approach make him difficult to use optimally without mastering his options. Possibly his biggest issue is his notably high learning curve; much practice is generally required for his command specials in order to use them reliably and consistently rather than accidentally inputting the wrong move."
Olimar,6,6.973,"Olimar is ranked 33rd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B+ tier. This is a slight drop to his placement in SSB4, where he was ranked 21st out of 54, and it is his lowest placement in the Super Smash Bros. series to date.","Olimar is a small, floaty, lightweight character. He has the 33rd slowest dashing speed, 8th slowest air speed, 32nd highest air acceleration (tied with Duck Hunt and Inkling, among others), very low gravity, low traction (tied with Diddy Kong), below-average falling speed, and above-average jump height. Due to these attributes, Olimar has below-average mobility for the most part.","What sets Olimar apart from a majority of the cast is that his stronger attacks do not come from him. Instead, he utilizes Pikmin to perform disjointed attacks and function as projectiles to attack opponents from a distance during his smash attacks, most of his aerial attacks, and his side special move. Olimar starts off with 3 Pikmin at the start of each battle, and can have up to 3 at any given point. Each Pikmin has their own hit points, and will die if they receive too much damage or fall into a blast zone. Pikmin are obtained in a specific order: Red, Yellow, Blue, White and Purple, then back to Red. Winged Pikmin also appear via Olimar's up special move, although they lack hurtboxes and hit points like the other Pikmin.

Pikmin Pluck, Olimar's neutral special move, enables him to gain Pikmin when used on any solid surface in the event he has less than 3 Pikmin available. It is very laggy when used in air, but is somewhat quick on the ground and is best used if spaced out. Pikmin Order, Olimar's down special move, can be used to quickly call all Pikmin back. It is a very quick and efficient cycling tool for getting to a desired Pikmin that has already been plucked. It also grants super armor during its first few frames, although this can be risky to use as a strictly defense measure due to the super armor's minimal amount of frames. It will function as a combo breaking move in dangerous situations as well.

Winged Pikmin, Olimar's up special move, is a very flexible recovery option. The Winged Pikmin can be moved freely around the air, and their travel can be canceled with an aerial attack. However, canceling the Winged Pikmin will render Olimar helpless. Additionally, consecutive usage of the Winged Pikmin will tire them out, which results in their travel distance and maneuverability both worsening. Although sporadic usage of the Winged Pikmin will prevent them from tiring out, their travel distance and maneuverability will still worsen depending on Olimar's lineup of Pikmin: Purple Pikmin are the heaviest, whereas White Pikmin are the lightest.

Olimar's side special move, Pikmin Throw, boasts excellent utility and is his primary damage-racking option. Olimar throws his Pikmin forward. The thrown Pikmin, except for Purple, cling to the target and deal elemental damage over time. Purple Pikmin don't cling to opponents and instead deal a single strong hit as they are in the air. If they don't land on a target, they become miniature, independent hurtboxes that run back toward Olimar. When clinging to the opponent, they can be killed or damaged by certain moves, such as a down smash that covers the user in a hitbox. However, this can be used to an advantage, as the Pikmin can be used to block certain moves such as Charge Shot, even when clinging to Samus. Pikmin Throw can also be used to get rid of unneeded or less useful Pikmin to get to a desired one if a different one needs to be plucked.

Each Pikmin has different properties that both affect how they interact with moves and Olimar's inputs. Red Pikmin have average projectile range, deal the second-highest damage, have the fire effect, reduce throw knockback, and are immune to fire attacks. Yellow Pikmin have an arcing path with slightly lower range, have the electric effect, have a larger hitbox (?50% larger compared to the other Pikmin), and are immune to electric attacks. Blue Pikmin have average projectile range, higher throw power and damage, have the water effect, and are immune to water attacks. White Pikmin have the longest projectile range, deal the least direct damage in exchange for the most cling damage, and have the darkness effect. Purple Pikmin have the shortest projectile range, but deal the most damage and knockback and do not cling to opponents but act as a standard projectile with knockback instead.

Neutral attack is a one-two combo that is quick overall, and is best suited for low percent set-ups into down tilt, a grab, and Pikmin Throw or if used for jab locking. Forward tilt is a wind-up punch that is laggy overall and his slowest tilt attack. However, it possesses respectable power that makes it useful for creating space and, more notably, it is his only non-Pikmin attack that can KO at reasonable percents. Up tilt is a simple spinning hop that is best suited as an anti-air move, yet can also set be followed up with an up aerial at low percents if the opponent fails to DI properly. Down tilt is Olimar's most useful tilt attack: it is a lunging tackle that can start combos at varying percents, 2 frame punish reliably, function as a pseudo-crawl, and is his best spacing option in most scenarios thanks to its quick start-up.

Olimar's aerials have great utility despite his mediocre air speed. His forward and back aerials are great for edgeguarding thanks to their wide arc. His up aerial is effective for juggling and combos into itself and low to medium percents, whereas his down aerial can meteor smash in its earlier frames while still possessing a weaker lingering hitbox in its later frames, thus making it a solid tool for denying juggles. Furthermore, using Olimar's Pikmin-based aerials cycles through his Pikmin, which can be either a blessing or curse depending on the situation. Olimar's neutral aerial is his only aerial that does not utilize Pikmin, and thus has much less range in comparison. However, it still has some utility as a niche combo tool and landing option.

Olimar's throws are disproportionately powerful for a character of his size, specifically while using blue Pikmin. Up throw is a reliable KO move above approximately 130% with blue Pikmin (having very high base knockback) and can potentially set up juggling scenarios, while down throw reliably combos into forward aerial at low to medium percents and Pikmin Throw at higher percents, meaning that he can get very large amounts of damage off of a grab. Both forward and back throws can kill at ledge at about 130%, and also can set up edgeguards and ledgetraps. (Note: Blue Pikmin drastically increase the knockback and damage of throws. White Pikmin increase the range of the grab itself, while Purple Pikmin lower grab range. Red Pikmin make throws deal decreased knockback, making them more useful for combos starting from a grab.)

Having relatively long range for a character of his size also makes Olimar great at camping out and approaching hand-to-hand combatants, such as Captain Falcon or Wario, and further accentuate his strong punishment game. All of Olimar's aforementioned qualities give him a strong damage racking capability to complement his zoning focused playstyle.","However, Olimar does have some noticeable weaknesses to counterbalance his strengths. One of his most noteworthy issues is his defenselessness without his Pikmin. Although they can be plucked rather quickly, he can only do so when on the ground and there is still enough time to punish Olimar if he doesn't secure his space before gaining more Pikmin. His physical attacks themselves also provide niche/situational utility compared to his Pikmin moves and have significantly less range. Therefore, he is at his greatest disadvantage if the opponent manages to keep him airborne and within his space due to the very short range and limited scope of his physical attacks. On the flipside, his recovery becomes noticeably worsened when he does have Pikmin; as a result, he may have to resort to casting them aside if it improves his chances of recovering safely, and thus ridding himself of major defenses.

Olimar's below-average dashing and air speeds also make him susceptible to rushdown-oriented fighters overwhelming him while he's in a disadvantage state. This, in turn, is further compounded by his aforementioned difficulty at escaping a disadvantage state without Pikmin. Finally, Olimar's zoning capabilities are severely hindered by characters with a reflector, as Olimar's side special is both a projectile and his primary damage-racking move. On top of that, all of Olimar's smash attacks do damage solely through the use of Pikmin as projectiles, making a reflected smash attack potentially deadly, even at low percents.

","Overall, Olimar is a versatile zoner who has an unorthodox manner of fighting involving the management of his Pikmin. Due to his poor disadvantage and his need for careful cycling and management of his Pikmin, he generally cannot afford to be reckless in his play."
Greninja,6,6.89,"Greninja is ranked 34th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it in the B+ tier. This is a marginal rise from its 26th out of 54 placement in SSB4.","Greninja, true to being a ninja-themed character, has very strong mobility; it has the 4th fastest walking speed, the 8th fastest run speed, the 10th fastest air speed, is tied for the 9th fastest falling and fast falling speed, the 2nd highest gravity, and possesses the 2nd highest jump height overall. However, unlike most characters who boast similar mobility (such as Sheik), Greninja boasts a surprising amount of KO options, good range on plenty of its attacks, and KO throws.","One of Greninja's most notable traits is its high mobility which complements its grounded moveset. Greninja's dash attack comes out on frame 7 and has very low ending lag, as well as the ability to cross upon shields. Its knockback angle allows for many true follow-ups and strings over a large range of percents. Its neutral jab attack comes out on frame 3, making it a good grounded combo breaker. It can also lock, which gives Greninja access to potent punishes from opponents missing techs. Its down tilt is an excellent combo starter due to its low startup, ending lag and vertical launch angle. Greninja's up tilt is a frame 9 disjointed hitbox that acts well as an anti-air and can also be a combo starter. Its smash attacks are also reliable in their own right; its forward smash is quick for its range and power, down smash is an excellent punishment option for ledge regrabs, as well as sending at a low angle, and up smash is a potent combo finisher.

Greninja also has a very strong air game due to its aforementioned air speed and jump height. Greninja's aerials are reliable for multiple situations and all have low landing lag (except for down aerial, at 30 frames). Its neutral aerial is a decent low percent combo starter due to it having incredibly low landing lag and a good launch angle. It can also KO at high percentages. Its forward aerial acts as a combo finisher from its combo starters and can KO moderately early. Forward aerial's low landing lag and disjointed nature also make it safe on shield in many situations when spaced correctly. Its up aerial is a great juggling option with low all-around lag and boasting good KO potential near the upper blast line. Greninja can also utilize its multihits to drag down opponents to create tech chase and jab lock situations. Its back aerial is a very fast follow up or offstage edgeguarding option. Down aerial can be used as a mix up to return to the stage from far above, as well as perform surprise combos on hit with both its meteor smash and sourspot hitbox.

Greninja's grab game is overall very effective, due to its grabs being among the longest ranges of any non-tether grab in the game. Its forward, up, and back throws can KO at high percentages. Down throw acts as a middle percent combo starter, as well as a strong DI mix up, especially at higher percentages at ledge as a 50/50 between DI in and out in conjunction with forward throw. Up throw acts as a versatile combo starter that can lead to juggling situations. Because of this, Greninja has plenty of options off of a grab, as not one of its throws could be considered useless.

Finally, Greninja's special moves are effective in various situations. Water Shuriken acts as a versatile zoning tool, as well as a high-percentage KO option when fully charged. At low-to-mid percents, it is also a combo starter, allowing Greninja to rush down its opponent and follow up with any aerial attack or an up smash. Shadow Sneak works as an effective recovery mix up, as well as a potent KO move from a good read or pseudo-combo finisher. Despite lacking an offensive hitbox, Hydro Pump is a good recovery move for its long distance, and can be used for gimping recoveries due to having windbox properties. Substitute is a counterattack with the unique attribute of being able to be aimed in one of 8 different directions upon a successful counter. These angled follow ups allow for Greninja to gain pseudo-follow ups as well as KO earlier by picking the optimal angle in regards to stage positioning.","However, Greninja is also flawed in many ways. One of Greninja's primary flaws is its inability to break out of disadvantage state. While not as bad as the previous game, Greninja still has difficulties escaping combos due to its fast falling speed and its aerials still having relatively high startup. This can sometimes be alleviated with its back or down aerials, but both are not very effective due to back aerial's almost entirely horizontal hitboxes and down aerial's landing lag. Another option is aerial Water Shuriken, which stalls Greninja in the air and can be used as a landing mix up, as well as Hydro Pump landing mix ups.

Another notable weaknesses is Greninja's multihit moves, especially back air and up air, being notoriously inconsistent, allowing opponents to escape out of these moves. As both aerials are some of Greninja's best combo tools, the inconsistency greatly affects its combo game.

Greninja's biggest weakness, however, is its terrible out of shield game, which is arguably the worst of the entire cast. Because of its high short hop, its aerials slow startup, and lacking a fast grab (although it has good range), Greninja lacks an effective out of shield option faster than frame 14. While its back aerial is fairly quick at frame 5 (making it frame 8 out of shield), it is unable to hit opponents in front of Greninja and is very inconsistent at hitting opponents behind Greninja due to its high short hop. Jumping or rolling out of shield are potential options to reset neutral, but they are very predictable and easily read. Thus, when Greninja is pinned down in shield, it has difficulty escaping the situation without being heavily punished. Combined with its vulnerability to combos, this gives it an atrocious defensive game.","Altogether, Greninja's playstyle requires players to think like an actual ninja: utilizing Greninja's superb mobility and fast attacks to rush down opponents, saving the slower attacks for potential mixups, mindgames and surprise KO options, and remaining unpredictable to prevent being trapped into disadvantageous positions."
Falco,6,6.871,"Falco is ranked 35th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B+ tier. This is a significant improvement over his low tier placement in SSB4, where he was ranked 46th out of 54 characters. Falco, unlike his fellow Star Fox brethren, is more centered on combos and advantage state, with his aerial combos being formidable and highly damaging. His up tilt is one of the best combo starters in the game, courtesy of him having the highest jump and vertical mobility in the game along with excellent aerial followups. Falco's edgeguarding is also very effective due to his aerials having either long-lasting hitboxes (neutral aerial and forward aerial) or being strong KO tools (back aerial and down aerial). His Blaster helps to force approaches and can aid with some defensive play and Falco Phantasm serves as a solid burst option to surprise opponents. His Reflector is his main anti-zoning tool, which can also help set up niche edgeguards and combos.

Despite these strengths, Falco has some weaknesses. Like Fox and Wolf, his endurance is not the greatest; in Falco's case, he is a lightweight character with the same predictable recovery issues as the other space animals due to Fire Bird and Falco Phantasm's linear angles. While Falco possesses one of the best vertical mobilities in the game, his horizontal mobility is not as formidable, as he lacks the grounded mobility of Fox and the air mobility of Wolf, giving him difficulty approaching and staying in neutral. While his combo game is strong, he lacks strong KO moves, making him reliant on moves such as down tilt, back air, or edgeguarding.

Overall, Falco's drastic improvements has resulted in him seeing significantly better representation in comparison to Smash 4. While the size of his playerbase pales compared to the other Star Fox fighters, Falco still sees solid results from players such as Tilde, M0tsunabE and MASA.","Falco is a lightweight character with the highest jump in the game, a fast initial dash speed, the 7th highest gravity, the 10th fastest walking speed, the 11th fastest falling speed, the 12th highest traction and the 9th best air acceleration, but in contrast has average dashing speed and the 23rd slowest air speed. This makes his movement somewhat polarizing as he has overall mediocre horizontal movement (especially while airborne), but excels in reaching impressive heights.","Owing to his status as a ""talented aerial fighter"" with an ""amazing jumping ability"" and fast falling speed, Falco's greatest strengths lie in his strong combo, juggling, and edgeguarding capabilities; with his aerials being most evident of these traits. Up aerial in particular, is his primary juggling tool, thanks to its quick startup, wide hitbox that can hit opponents on landing, and low overall lag and knockback. These traits make it very effective at starting and extending juggles, and as well as being capable of comboing into itself and other aerials. Additionally, it can KO at high percents near the upper blast line. Neutral aerial has a large, lasting hitbox that covers Falco and is a fast multi-hit, making it a good disruptor and combo extender/finisher. It can also drag opponents downward, allowing it to start combos on stage. Forward aerial has decent horizontal range and is also a lasting multi-hit, allowing it to edgeguard and KO reliably. Like his neutral aerial, it can drag opponents downward as well, potentially leaving offstage opponents in a very vulnerable position. Back aerial is one of the strongest aerials of its kind and can reliably KO even from center-stage. Lastly, down aerial, while nowhere near as notorious as its previous iterations, comes out fast and is a lasting hitbox; with its clean hit being a powerful meteor smash, giving it the ability to start combos onstage and score early KOs against poor recoveries.

Although Falco's ground game appears limited, he has a handful of respectable options at his disposal. Up tilt, in particular is Falco's staple in initiating combos thanks to its very quick startup, large hitboxes, and low ending lag and knockback. It can combo into itself and any of his aerials, and even setup for KO's into back aerial or up aerial at high percents. Down tilt, despite being Falco's most powerful tilt, is also capable of follow-ups into aerials thanks to its sourspots' lower power. Additionally, it covers a good distance in front of himself, allowing him to KO grounded opponents with ease or 2-frame many recoveries. Forward smash has considerable range and respectable KO power, while down smash starts up quickly and sends at a semi-spike angle, working as another quick KO option and heavily threatening those with poor recoveries. His other moves, although more situational, still have their uses: neutral attack comes out exceedingly quick and its first two hits can lock, forward tilt can be angled and is relatively fast, allowing it to be used as a decent neutral option, and dash attack has a long duration, enabling it to catch dodges and landings, with its clean hit sending at a favorable angle for juggles and its late hit setting up for potential edgeguards.

Complementing Falco's aerials and tilts is his grab game, as shielding too often provides Falco the opportunity to make use of his highly damaging throws. Up throw is highly useful, as much like up tilt, it is an effective combo starter into any of his aerials at all percents and can perform KO setups or even outright KO with its second hit. Down throw combos into forward aerial at low percents and forward, while lacking true combos, is useful for setting up edgeguards and tech-chases. Finally, back throw's first hit is a semi-spike that sets up for Falco's strong edgeguarding game, while its second hit can outright KO at high percents near the ledge.

Considering his versatile moveset, Falco's specials can provide unique benefits. Blaster is his primary ranged option, with it being an effective disruptor due to its fast projectile and surprisingly low ending lag. Its shots can be used to pressure, provoke or halt approaches, snipe double jumps, or even outright gimp poor recoveries. Falco Phantasm propels Falco a significant distance very quickly, making it great for horizontal recovery. Its grounded version can start combos at low to mid percents and even set up KOs with back aerial at high percents, while its aerial version can meteor smash careless edgeguarders and even 2-frame low recoveries. Fire Bird is his primary recovery option and grants respectable distance in any chosen direction. Falco can notably use it in conjuction with footstool as an out of shield option; it has damaging hitboxes throughout and can deal up to 40% if all hits connect. Lastly, Reflector activates on frame 1, making reacting to projectiles less of a liability for Falco; it also has a hitbox which activates slightly later that serves as a decent poking tool.","In spite of Falco's well-balanced strengths, he has numerous weaknesses. His most prominent flaws are his survivability and his inconsistency. Despite being a lightweight, Falco is vulnerable to combos due to his fast falling speed and lack of reliable escape options. Although Falco's recovery grants respectable distance, it is very linear. Falco Phantasm no longer passes through shields, making it far easier to corner him and force him offstage as a result. Without his double jump, Falco is in great danger offstage due to the nerfs to air dodging and his two recovery options each being slow and predictable.

Regarding his moveset, Falco has several moves that do not function properly and can even work against him. Up smash, despite having fast startup and high vertical reach, has large blind spots that often miss outright against many grounded opponents, leaving him extremely vulnerable from behind and against small or crouching opponents (even if they're directly in front of Falco). Plaguing him since Smash 4, both up tilt and up smash are prone to failing to properly connect against aerial opponents. Despite its appearance, neutral aerial has difficulty hitting opponents from behind, and due to changes in the game's engine, the move's looping hits are more prone to missing than they were in the previous installment. While Blaster and Reflector have reduced lag, the former is still unsafe on hit even from a distance, while the latter still has a misleadingly small hitbox and its removed trip chance ironically makes it even more unsafe on hit overall than in Smash 4. Most notoriously, however, are Falco's back and up throws. Due to changes in the game's physics, the laser from both throws are even more susceptible to DI than before, allowing opponents to survive what otherwise would effortlessly KO.

These aforementioned problems compound Falco's other, more defined weakness of struggling to secure a KO. Like fellow Star Fox fighters Fox and Wolf, Falco's strongest moves are also his slowest in terms of startup and/or endlag, requiring careful execution in order to avoid heavy punishment. Lastly, Falco's damage output and range have been nerfed from Smash 4. This is especially noteworthy due to most of the cast receiving various buffs not limited to these aspects and the prominence of swordfighters and zoners in Ultimate.","Overall, Falco has the tools that let him defensively pressure his opponent, then effectively capitalize on their errors with his strong combo and edgeguarding capabilities. However, he can struggle keeping up with opponents who can outmaneuver or outrange his options. Although he can score early KOs through a well-executed edgeguard or hard read, Falco must be careful not to let opponents take advantage of his own weaknesses to avoid being combo'd and KO'd early himself."
Mii Fighter,6,6.807,"The Mii Brawler is currently ranked 36th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list in the B+ tier, making him the highest-ranking Mii Fighter in the game. This is a significant improvement from his Super Smash Bros. 4 iteration, where he was ranked 55th out of 57 on that game's third tier list before ultimately going unranked on the fourth one. This also makes Ultimate's Mii Brawler the highest ranked Mii Fighter in the series. Mii Brawler possesses high mobility and fast frame data, allowing him to have a strong combo game that can lead into a KO, especially on stages with platforms or short ceilings. Additionally, Custom Moves allow for an extra degree of adaptability and are commonly allowed in tournament play, with some options having very effective strengths, such as Suplex (an extremely damaging command grab) and all three up special moves (Soaring Axe Kick is a surprisingly disjointed and effective out of shield option with a powerful meteor smash, Helicopter Kick has potent combo and KO potential at the sides of a stage, and Thrust Uppercut can net early KOs through platform combos). Overall, this gives the Brawler an effective rushdown combo playstyle.

However, not all of his weaknesses can be mitigated by specials. Mii Brawler has exceptionally poor range, even compared to other close-range fighters like Mario or Wolf, and his combo ability starts falling off at higher percents, making it difficult to close off stocks due to his lack of reliable high-percent KO confirms. His fast fallspeed limits his edgeguarding and leaves him prone to long combos like Fox, and his weight is the lightest out of the Mii Fighters, giving the Brawler the lowest survivability. Finally, his recovery, while customizable and varied, can be rather lacking, as most of his recovery moves grant average distance apart from a few options, such as Feint Jump, and his aforementioned fast falling speed further compounds this issue.

Overall, Mii Brawler is widely considered a well-rounded, close-range fighter with tools to deal with any situation. Most Mii Brawler usage have been as a secondary from players such as Rizeasu, however Mii Brawler has seen success as a solo-main, especially from KID.","Being the ""up close and personal"" Mii Fighter, the Brawler now possesses a good walking/dashing speed (tied with Toon Link and Mewtwo for walk speed and the 25th fastest dash speed) and the ability to wall jump in exchange for now being a middleweight fighter (sharing the same weight as Inkling, Ness, and Lucas) with a fast falling speed, an above-average air speed, and an average air acceleration. As a Mii Fighter, his specials are determinant on the player's choice. Like the other two Mii Fighters, he have access to 12 different specials: Shot Put, Flashing Mach Punch, and Exploding Side Kick (Neutral Special), Onslaught, Burning Dropkick, and Suplex (Side Special), Soaring Axe Kick, Helicopter Kick, and Thrust Uppercut (Up Special), and Head-On Assault, Feint Jump, and Counter Throw (Down Special).","As with other Mii Fighters, one of the strengths of the Mii Brawler is his diverse set of special moves. Many of his specials help rack up damage, improve his recovery, or possess fantastic KO power. Shot Put is a fantastic tool for edgeguarding due to its arc and strong knockback. Moves such as Burning Dropkick and Feint Jump both aid the Brawler's recovery, providing decent horizontal distance. Suplex serves as a potent mindgame special, as well as an excellent way of racking up damage, dealing about 20% for each successful Suplex landed, even when stale.

Accompanying his varying specials, the Mii Brawler is a fairly nimble fighter with great combo potential. His walking and dashing speed is above average and many of his normals have relatively low start-up and ending lag. All of his tilts and aerials (with the exception of down aerial) come out fairly quickly and are safe on shield when properly spaced or timed. Up tilt can lead to airdodge chases at very low percentages and chain into itself at low-mid percentages while down tilt can combo into forward aerial and neutral aerial at low percentages and other aerials/special moves at higher percentages. Neutral aerial is an excellent sex kick that boasts a wide range of utility due to its speed and extremely low landing lag, making it a very useful tool for edgeguarding, initiating, continuing, and breaking combos, and approaching. Forward tilt serves as a decent spacing tool due to it no longer having a sour spot and its ability to be angled while his down throw is a very good combo initiator, capable of comboing into a variety of moves. Dash attack comes out very quick and stays active for a long time while covering a large distance, making it extremely effective for whiff punishing or catching landing opponents. Additionally, Mii Brawler has a plethora of moves that have high KO potential. Forward smash deals extremely high knockback and can kill at low-mid percentages, and additionally be confirmed out of a landing neutral air at mid percentages. The initial hit of up smash is a potent finisher that has very low start-up. Many of his specials can secure early KOs as well, especially Thrust Uppercut and Helicopter Kick. Exploding Side Kick is as strong as Falcon Punch and is safe on shield, Head-On Assault, Suplex and Soaring Axe Kick can perform sacrificial KOs at low percentages (the first of which also breaking shields), and Counter Throw is among the strongest counters in the game.

In addition to his normals, All of Mii Brawler's throws except for back throw serve a purpose past positioning. Down throw is Brawler's strongest throw in most situations, as it confirms into almost any aerial until high percentages, at which point it can be used to confirm into Helicopter Kick or Thrust Uppercut. At extremely high percents (190%+) It will begin to KO opponents off the top of stages with lower ceiling blastzones. Forward throw also serves as a kill throw, capable of killing opponents at high yet reasonable percents near ledge, where they may be expecting another kill move like back aerial or up smash, adding to Mii Brawler's corner pressure. Lastly, while up throw does not kill or combo, it does the most damage of any of Mii Brawler's throws at 11% (13.8% in 1v1s), making it a useful tool for simultaneously dealing a large amount of damage and setting the opponent up for juggling.

Additionally, Mii Brawler has a plethora of excellent defensive tools. Neutral aerial serves as a quick out of shield option with its 6-frame start-up, factoring in the initial jump squat frames. Up Smash hits on frame 8 and has Mii Brawler's legs intangible for the first half of its active frames making it a great anti-air option. Finally, All of Mii Brawler's Up Specials also serve as great out of shield options with Soaring Axe Kick having excellent range to punish disjointed attacks and retreating aerials, Helicopter Kick coming out as fast as Up Smash while being reversable, and Thrust Uppercut being Mii Brawler's fastest OOS option at frame 3, allowing it act both as a punish to some of the game's safest moves and a pre-emptive anti-air against landing aerials and jumping opponents.

In terms of recovery, Mii Brawler has some good options. Soaring Axe Kick has great height but suffers horizontally. Burning Dropkick, Helicopter Kick and Feint Jump provide better horizontal recovery. Feint Jump, much like Zero Suit Samus' Flip Jump, is a good tool that can both mix up and extend Mii Brawler's otherwise lackluster recovery as well as aid in escaping juggles thanks to its frame 2 invincibility, a frame faster than his airdodge. It can also be used to cancel one's momentum in order to survive at slightly higher percents. However, if Mii Brawler is hit out of Feint Jump, he will be unable to use it again until he grabs a ledge or lands on stage. Burning Dropkick can be used multiple times and its decent travel distance can be further improved by B-reversing it in the air. Helicopter Kick travels at a low angle, giving it excellent horizontal recovery potential but weak height. Thrust Uppercut is a fast recovery option but is perhaps the most restrictive up special Mii Brawler has for recovery.","However, Mii Brawler does not come without his own flaws. In exchange for his decent mobility and speed, his middleweight status doesn't grant him high survivability. This is further exacerbated by his fast falling speed and susceptibility to combos. Furthermore, the Mii Brawler lacks tools to force approaches and has to make hard commitments with moves such as neutral air or dash attack when approaching due to a lack of safe options.

Another issue with the Mii Brawler is a lack of reliable KO confirms at high percents. At those percentages, many of Mii Brawler's combo setups stop confirming. Many of his KO options are flawed, being extremely laggy (Such as Forward Smash and Onslaught) or having poor range (Down Smash and Up Smash). What few confirming moves Mii Brawler does have at these percents in landing up aerial or neutral aerial can cause Mii Brawler to become predictable. Because of this, he must rely on back aerial, out-of-shield options, hard reads and tech-chasing to secure stocks without assistance from confirms.","Overall, the Mii Brawler is a jack-of-all-trades amalgamation of all hand-to-hand based fighters. The ability to mix and match several different special moves adds a unique layer of versatility by allowing several different playstyles and gameplans for the same basic fighter, making Mii Brawler among the most unpredictable to fight against. Depending on circumstances, The moveset of Mii Brawler can be updated to better combat an opponent, such as using Helicopter Kick for heavier opponents or Soaring Axe Kick versus characters with disjoints. However, all of the customizable special moves have a flaw to prevent them from being overpowered and/or are an inferior version of a similar move other fighters possess, such as Feint Jump to Flip Jump or Head-On Assault to Bowser Bomb . The character's very good frame data, above-average mobility, and a variety of moves that can combo, juggle, and secure KOs are held back by his poor range and limited off-stage presence due to his fast fall speed. While his strengths do overshadow his weaknesses, many players have considered the Mii Brawler to be generally inferior to characters who have a similar fighting archetype such as Mario and Squirtle."
Sephiroth,6,6.722,"Sephiroth is ranked 37th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B+ tier. Sephiroth's greatest strength is his unrivaled range and spacing game, the latter of which is courtesy of the Masamune, which grants him the ability to reach farther than most fighters and apply pressure against his opponents without having to risk getting up close. This range is complemented by Masamune's sweetspots, which deal high damage and possess incredible KO power. Furthermore, Sephiroth has a strong set of special attacks, with Flare Variations helping his ledgetrapping abilities and Shadow Flare being an excellent pressure, combo and kill setup tool. Finally, at higher percents, Sephiroth will gain access to his unique Winged Form, which grants him increased attack power, higher mobility, armor on his smash attacks, and a second double jump throughout the form's duration.

However, Sephiroth has some glaring weaknesses, the most prominent being his endurance and slow frame data. He is a lightweight, and paired with a relatively tall hurtbox, it makes him easier to hit and KO than other characters. Furthermore, a large portion of Sephiroth's kit is afflicted by slow frame data, with most of his attacks aside from his neutral attack coming out at frame 14 or more. This slow frame data also affects Masamune, which combined with its lackluster, narrow hitbox, means Sephiroth has more trouble when fighting up close or against smaller opponents. Lastly, due to being a comeback-oriented mechanic, Sephiroth's Winged From requires him to be at a noticeable disadvantage in order to be accessed, and upon dissipating, it can only be reactivated after Sephiroth is KO'd.

Overall, Sephiroth's range and power allows him to pressure from a farther range than most fighters, however his weaknesses when fighting up close means that he is also rather susceptible to the opponent's pressure. He saw above-average representation in his earlier years in competitive play thanks to the efforts of players such as KEN, Ned, and Tweek, however his weaknesses became more apparent over time, leading to a decline in representation.","Sephiroth is a tall, lightweight fighter, tied with Kirby, Mewtwo, Pikachu and Olimar as the 7th lightest in the game. He has the 14th slowest walking speed, yet his dashing speed and traction are both above-average, with the former being marginally faster than Hero's. Despite his height, Sephiroth's crouch is deceptively low. In the air, Sephiroth's overall jumping force and air acceleration are both average, he has slow air speed and below-average air friction, and yet he has the 11th fastest falling speed and above-average gravity. Notably, Sephiroth's short hop is tied with Steve's for the lowest in the game, which aids him very well in the neutral game.","Sephiroth's possesses a unique fighter ability: the Winged Form. Like Aura and Super Special Moves, it is a comeback mechanic that activates when Sephiroth has received sufficient damage. This threshold is influenced by the score count/stock count; it activates at ?90% when the score/stock count is even and will activate earlier or later if Sephiroth's score/stock count is behind or above the opponent's, respectively. Upon activation, Sephiroth's wing unfurls and grants him a third jump, a 1.3× damage multiplier, and much higher mobility overall. In particular, Sephiroth gains the 7th fastest dashing speed (tied with Zero Suit Samus'), the highest traction (surpassing Sonic's), as well as higher air speed, air acceleration and air friction. Sephiroth's smash attacks also gain damage-based armor that can withstand up to 20%, making them incredibly risky to challenge, save for a few exceptions. Winged Form deactivates after a cetain amount of time based on attacking and especially KOing opponents.

Sephiroth's ground game offers him fairly crucial tools, with a moveset reminiscent of Cloud to similar effects. Neutral attack, despite having the shortest range of his grounded moves, is Sephiroth's fastest move while having decent melee range for a neutral attack, making it one of his few reliable tools to quickly ward off an opponent. Forward tilt has incredibly long range (comparable to Simon's) and can be angled, making it a superb spacing option and a viable KO option at high percentages when fresh, especially in Winged Form. Up tilt boasts incredible vertical range, a decently long duration, can scoop opponents in front of him and renders his upper body intangible for a brief period. Down tilt is Sephiroth's fastest tilt attack and, although it is slightly slower than Cloud's down tilt, it functions almost identically to his: it boasts great range by propelling Sephiroth forward and significantly lowers his hurtbox, giving him a way to punish more ranged attacks. Dash attack, despite being fairly punishable due to being his slowest melee attack, covers a lot of ground and has respectable power, making it useful as both a burst option and a situational but potent KO option.

Sephiroth's smash attacks also boast varying degrees of utility. Forward smash is a very long-ranged slash that is potent at punishing and spacing, especially in Winged Form, and boasts excellent KO potential at the middle of the blade, but is very slow and easily punishable. Up smash is an overhead arcing slash, much like Ganondorf and Ike's up smashes. Although it is weaker than theirs and slower than Ganondorf's, it is Sephiroth's best anti-air option due to sporting more range overall, to the point that it allows him to cover an area wider than an entire platform of Town and City. Down smash only hits in front of Sephiroth, but it is faster than his forward smash and has the unique property of becoming even stronger if the Masamune's blade hits the ground, dealing immense shield damage. This makes it a good mix up tool to break shields and a niche edgeguarding option due to how low the hitbox extends.

Sephiroth's air game also comprised of long ranged options. Neutral aerial has the shortest range, but is his fastest option in the air, covers his entire body, and its overall low lag allows it to be used very flexibly, such as for warding off close-ranged opponents, including from out of shield, or for starting or continuing combos. Forward and back aerials serve similar purposes as spacing options in the air. Forward aerial comes out faster and is a stabbing attack with a tipper sweetspot and has a unique property where it can be used to pierce solid walls and perform a pseudo-wall cling up to three times in a row before landing. Back aerial is Sephiroth's strongest aerial and is a slashing attacking with a middle sweetspot, making it incredibly deadly in Winged Form, even if used from a short hop. Up aerial, like up smash, covers a wide arc above Sephiroth, though its sluggish frame data makes it punisable if used recklessly. Sephiroth's down aerial, Hell's Gate, is a powerful stall-then-fall that is a meteor smash at the start; when combined with its massive range, going an incredible distance underneath surfaces, it can reliably 2 frame punish an opponent.

Sephiroth's grab game is surprisingly effective compared to other sword users. He holds the distinction of having three combo throws, though each gradually becomes less effective the more damaged the opponent is. Down throw is Sephiroth's most varied combo throw until mid-percentages, as it can lead into neutral, forward, back and up aerials, or be used for mix-ups. It also becomes even more effective in Winged Form in spite of rage, as Sephiroth's enhanced mobility can allow him to catch up to the opponent faster. At low percentages, up throw can set the opponent up for a neutral aerial or up tilt, the former of which can lead to longer combos and the latter of which can lead to juggling. Back throw launches at a favorable angle while having low ending lag. This makes it notable for leading into follow-ups until high percentages, including an infamous KO confirm into back aerial, which becomes especially dangerous when he is in Winged Form. In stark contrast to his other throws, forward throw lacks combo potential, but is nevertheless useful. Thanks to being a semi-spike, it can be used to set up an edge-guard or a tech chase, which could potentially allow him to score an early KO.

Sephiroth's side special, Shadow Flare, is unique among chargeable projectiles in that, while the initial projectile deals little damage and cause flinching, it generates larger, darkness projectiles that do not immediately attack the opponent, but instead orbit around them and deal damage by homing in. Depending on how long it is charged, one to three projectiles can be generated by a single Shadow Flare, and up to five projectiles can be orbiting a single opponent at a time. Its range is also comparable to his sword attacks on top of having low lag all around, making it easily spammable and useful for spacing.

Sephiroth's neutral special, Flare, is a more traditional projectile that can be charged between three different projectiles of different properties: Flare is the quickest and travels slow but has the longest range; Megaflare is stronger overall and has a larger blast radius, at the cost of some range; and Gigaflare has the shortest range and the longest charge time, but has the largest blast radius and deals the most damage (enough to instantly break a shield while in Winged Form) and the strongest knockback, making it an effective way of pressuring at the edge for an edge-guard, or as a way to extend the damage the opponent takes as punishment from a shield break.

Sephiroth's up special, Blade Dash, is a dashing blade attack that functions differently depending on if the button was tapped or held. Tapped Blade Dash is a single-hitting move that sweetspots edges easily. When held, the move becomes Octaslash, which travels slightly farther, has huge range and hits multiple times, dealing higher damage and knockback at the cost of sweetspotting edges.

Lastly, his down special, Scintilla, is unique among counterattacks in that it will always produce a hitbox regardless of whether or not any attacks were countered, while its multi-hitting nature allows it to pressure shields, and is one of the strongest counters in the game with a 1.5× damage multiplier. However, Scintilla only covers in front of Sephiroth and has a damage cap of 25%; any attack that exceeds this cap will break the move, doing no damage but putting Sephiroth in a flinching animation and pushing him slightly backwards.

One of Sephiroth's most defining traits is his range. He notably sports among the longest overall range in Ultimate, thanks to his signature weapon, the Masamune, and surpassed only by Min Min in this regard. This gives him a great advantage in terms of safety and pressure. Unlike other swordfighters, Sephiroth's sweetspot hitboxes differ between his stabbing and slashing attacks: his stabs (up tilt, down smash, forward aerial, and down aerial) have sweetspots positioned along the tip of Masamune (very much like Marth and Simon's own tippers) with a mediumspot at the center of the blade, whereas his slashes (forward tilt, forward smash, up smash, back aerial, and up aerial) have sweetspots positioned along the upper center of its blade (similarly to Roy's inverse tipper, but with better range overall) with mediumspots at the tip. Opponents can be deterred from approaching over fear of being hit at any time, and the various sweet spots force opponents into certain positions to avoid the most damage, which Sephiroth can use to trap and punish them. Sephiroth's extremely low short hop also helps him in the neutral game, as it allows him to mix up whichever attack he will use, allowing his other attacks to be kept fresh until he is in a prime position to use them. Said tools, combined with his grounded mobility, can sometimes even help him counteract opponents with good zoning games, such as Toon Link, Villager, or Simon. Sephiroth's range can also allow him to effectively poke opponents, gradually whittling away at both their health and patience until they are forced to take drastic actions that could easily backfire. Thanks to Shadow Flare, the opponent can also eventually be put into said disadvantage more easily at best, or simply force them to avoid the damage and thus reset the neutral game at worst. His Winged Form helps significantly on both regards, as his increased mobility allows Sephiroth to reposition himself more easily while also increasing the damage he can deal and, unlike other fighter abilities like Limit Gauge or Rebellion Gauge, it will not disappear until Sephiroth is KO'd or has inflicted a lot of damage, which can potentially lead to him turning the tables on the opponent should they try to play around him carelessly.","However, Sephiroth also possesses a notable amount of weaknesses. The most notable is his frailty: Sephiroth's tall frame results in him being prone to get more easily hit by most attacks, which is further compounded by him being a fast falling lightweight. Much like Mewtwo, these traits collectively result in Sephiroth being easy to combo and KO compared to many other characters of his size and/or weight. Adding to this is Sephiroth's recovery: his polarized air physics result in him covering a mediocre distance midair, meaning that careless use of his resources can lead Sephiroth to be easily edge-guarded or gimped, in spite of both of his recovery options having their perks. Blade Dash, his quickest recovery option, does not cover as much distance as other recovery moves and does not fully protect Sephiroth other than from the front, which can leave him vulnerable to sufficiently disjointed moves. On the other hand, Octaslash offers excellent protection that can deter opponents from edge-guarding Sephiroth because of its range and power making it useful for edge-guard breaking, but has the slowest start-up, leaving Sephiroth vulnerable to being put at a worse position in the air. Semi-spikes can also be especially deadly for Sephiroth, as his air physics do not give him too much air time.

Furthermore, Sephiroth's overall frame data is unimpressive to compensate for his long range. Even his fastest aerial attack, neutral aerial, has mediocre start-up for an attack of its kind. This means that opponents can easily punish Sephiroth if certain moves are spammed or used carelessly. On top of this, Sephiroth's sword moves at the base of the Masamune all deal poor damage, knockback, and pushback, meaning that if improperly spaced, Sephiroth's moves can be easily punished at close range. Moves like up tilt and forward aerial have narrow ranges that can easily be avoided or shielded, while up aerial and down aerial are highly commital attacks that are sometimes difficult to reliably connect. Outside of neutral aerial, Sephiroth's melee-based moves also tend to have high ending lag, which results in him not having much in the way of mixing up his pressure at close range. Adding to this is Sephiroth's grab game, which is polarized in spite of its respectable utility; his grabs are short-ranged, his pummel is merely average, and his throws lack KO potential due to their meager damage outputs, average knockback, and/or unsuitable launching angles. All of these issues result in a poor close-quarters game that, when combined with his frailty, collectively culminates in Sephiroth being vulnerable to rushdown-based pressure if the opponent is able to keep up with his defense, such as Captain Falcon or Pikachu.

Another prominent issue on Sephiroth's moveset is his inconsistent KO potential. Due to his moves' sourspots, Sephiroth must always be at a distance from the opponent in order for them to KO reliably. His differing sweetspot mechanics can also work against him, due to how varied their locations are. His stab attacks possess narrow ranges and require the opponent to be at their longest range in order to be effective, which can result in them missing. On the other hand, his slash attacks do not require perfect spacing at long range to be effective, but their sweetspots are harder to land as a result of being located between the weaker sourspots and mediumspots. In regard to sword attacks, Octaslash should also be noted in that it only becomes consistently reliable for KOing while the Winged Form is active. Outside of his sweetspotted sword attacks, Sephiroth does not have many reliable ways to KO an opponent. Although dash attack's clean hit KOs at reasonable percentages, its slow start-up can make it easily predictable.

Flare's decent damage output is mostly counterbalanced by its middling knockback and slow start-up and speed, making them easy to shield, absorb, or reflect. This results in it failing to KO at reasonable percentages like Megaflare and Gigaflare, which themselves are compensated by even less range and even slower start-up. As a result, Sephiroth must be careful when it comes to being able to secure KOs in spite of his impressive damage racking potential. Although Shadow Flare has low overall lag, it still must be used wisely, especially if used by a character with a reflector, as it can result in Sephiroth being struck for high damage himself and allow the opponent to capitalize on it. While Octaslash covers a great distance on its own and is risky to edge-guard, characters with counterattacks can easily use this to their advantage, which can leave Sephiroth at an even worse spot for recovering. Finally, despite its animation suggesting otherwise, Scintilla cannot reflect projectiles whatsoever (although it can stop them without effort). It also does not directly protect Sephiroth (especially from behind) and its damaging hitbox is treated as a projectile, making it a double-edged sword if reflected.

Last but not least, Sephiroth's Winged Form suffers from its own limitations. Despite the wide array of benefits it grants, including being able to mitigate the previously mentioned weaknesses, it only activates whenever Sephiroth receives damage, and is further dependent on his standing relative to the opponent. While the Winged Form can activate as low as 30% if Sephiroth is 2 stocks behind the opponent, it conversely activates as late as 110% if Sephiroth is 2 stocks ahead. Thus, the Winged Form suffers from consistency issues similarly to Aura in that Sephiroth will have to play very carefully if he is to keep his advantage, which is easier said than done due to his noticeable frailty. Although the Winged Form's damage-based armor on Sephiroth's smash attacks can definitely help him power through incoming offense, reckless usage of his smash attacks can render him predictable and open to being punished. Additionally, Sephiroth cannot regain the Winged Form until he gets KO'd, which can result in Winged form going to waste if Sephiroth is not able to capitalize on its benefits properly.","In the end, Sephiroth is arguably the most unique swordfighter in Ultimate, as his playstyle is a polarizing hybrid of the glass cannon and turtle archetypes, resulting in a high learning curve. His high overall damage output, immense range, varied sweetspots and effective projectiles grant him a respectably solid ranged melee playstyle, as it can become difficult for the opponent to approach Sephiroth should he consistently make the right choices, and it is equally difficult to surmount him should he break through the opponent's zone or defense. However, Sephiroth's inconsistent KO potential, polarized grab game, and poor close-quarters game can leave a much-to-be-desired offensive playstyle, and he is just as susceptible to pressure as much as he can dish it out himself. The benefits offered from his Winged Form can seriously help him on this regard, as it can help him greatly recover from a deficit should he be able to survive long enough, but his frailty means he also must play carefully in order to retain this advantage."
Young Link,6,6.694,"Young Link is ranked 38th out of 82 on the tier list in the B+ tier. This is an overall improvement from his mid-tier placement in Melee, where he was ranked 17th out of 26. Young Link possesses great frame data and combo ability. The low knockback on his attacks allows him to rack up damage quickly and his disjointed range provides him safety from getting too close to his opponent. His projectiles also benefit his combo game, most notably his Fire Arrow, which has low startup lag and sends his opponents upwards. Young Link also possesses kill confirms at high percentages thanks to the first hit of his forward aerial.

Young Link is not without his shortcomings, however. Young Link has low range for a swordfighter, which forces him to get up close to deal effective damage, a flaw further worsened by him being a lightweight. His recovery is very punishable due to its predictable arcs. He also struggles to get KOs at high percents if he isn't able to get kill confirms, with his safest moves having very little KO power.

Overall, Young Link is often seen as the best of the three Links, and fares very well in the competitive environment thanks to strong results from players such as Toast, Kobe, and Supahsemmie.","Young Link is a lightweight character (weighing the same as Greninja and Isabelle), and is the lightest of the three Links, being 3 units lighter than Toon Link. Compared to his alternate timeline counterparts, he tends to be in the middle in regard to mobility, including his running speed, air speed and acceleration, and jump height. He has the highest fall speed and initial dash of the Links, though his fast fall speed is slower than the original Link thanks to Link's unusual fast fall speed boost. In terms of the rest of the cast, Young Link has an average running speed, high initial dash speed, low air speed and acceleration, high falling speed, and slightly above-average jump height. Finally, his gravity is average and tied with Link's. Overall, Young Link has middling mobility, with most of his quick movement potential coming from his high initial dash and fall speed.","Young Link's moveset is regarded as one of the best and most reliable in the entire game. While even the best characters in the game usually have one or two moves in their moveset regarded as unusually weak or situational, every one of Young Link's moves is strong and flexible, with a mix of versatile ranged combat and robust boxing.

Young Link uses the Kokiri Sword, the starting weapon from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, granting him disjointed range and giving him the ability to space out his opponents, as well as making his sword attacks risky to trade with unless the opponent has disjointed range of their own. Unlike many sword users, however, this is coupled with outstanding frame data. Although the Link archetype has been synonymous with laggy frame data up until Ultimate, Young Link has some of the best frame data in the game, with many of his moves being infamous for how quickly they come out and how little cooldown they have. As a result, many moves of his are extremely safe on shield, such as his down tilt, neutral air, forward air, back air, and even his Boomerang. Additionally, the speed of his moveset makes it reliable for one of Young Link’s most notable aspects: his combo game.

While the Link archetype is one that has never been known for combos, Young Link subverts this by providing one of the most complex and varied combo games out of the entire cast. His up tilt and especially down tilt are well designed to start combos, knocking the opponents up into the air with weak knockback to set up for his aerials, while his jab can transition into a rapid jab for respectable damage, create mixups through his surprisingly fast jab cancels, or be used to jab lock opponents and set up combos with down tilt or finish stocks with an up special or forward smash. However, his aerials are truly what gives him the outstanding combo and boxing game he has. Most of Young Link's aerials are capable of both starting combos as well as continuing them, making their usage very flexible and wide, as well as dealing significant damage.

His neutral aerial, perhaps his best aerial, is a simple sex kick. Its late hit in particular is extremely good for combos, being able to both start and continue them well into high percentages and being able to be followed up with a majority of Young Link's moveset. It can also lead to tech chase situations at high percents when the move causes opponents to go into tumble. Meanwhile, the clean hit is very reliable at warding off opponents, prevents other combo-oriented characters from overwhelming Young Link with combos of their own, has enough power to kill at high percentages, and provides him with a fast, safe and reliable out of shield option. Overall, the sheer utility of this move has caused it to gain a reputation as one of the best aerials in the game.

Young Link's forward and back aerials are both designed similarly. Both are combo attacks that consist of a first weak hit that stuns the enemy in place for a second launching hit. However, these are both meant to be used in different ways. His back aerial is much more geared towards combos as it comes out fast, has very little lag, and deals minimal knockback, making it easy to follow up with another back aerial or another move. His forward aerial is instead a combo finisher as it comes out slower and recovers slower than his back air in exchange for having much more power and knockback, providing significant KO power. Notably, canceling either of these moves by landing after the first hit allows Young Link to combo in to almost any move in his kit depending on the situation.

The up aerial is a thrust above Young Link that comes out very fast for how strong it is and lingers a while, making it useful for covering the space above him. It can be used to juggle opponents, as its large disjoint makes it hard to challenge. Additionally, his up aerial is a powerful KO move and can be comboed into quite flexibly. His down aerial, while not being a combo tool except in relatively rare situations, serves as a reliable landing option or jump callout due to its lingering, disjointed hitbox and considerable power even on the late hit.

Young Link's special moves grant him many more options to work with. Like his normals they tend to be fast, flexible and safe. Fire Arrow fires a flaming arrow in front of Young Link. It is incredibly fast and quick-recovering, and even an uncharged arrow travels a respectable distance, making it a very persistent poking tool when zoning. The arrow itself also deals low upwards knockback with high hitstun, making them reliable combo starters, provided Young Link is close enough to his opponent or can catch the upward knockback with another projectile (including another arrow). Fire Arrow can also be charged, allowing it to fly further and do more damage than a noncharged arrow, which can be useful for catching landings, mixing up timings against certain reflectors, or pressuring far away targets. However, this charge cannot be stored, unlike moves such as Charge Shot.

Boomerang is slower than Fire Arrow, but comes with the perks of more damage, lasting much longer, being able to be thrown at different angles, and returning to Young Link after travelling a certain distance, meaning that the opponent must remain aware of the Boomerang’s location even after it has passed them. Boomerang is best used as a lingering trap to grant Young Link stage control and for challenging people above or below you with its many angles. Interestingly, a point blank Boomerang is actually safe on shield against most of the cast, something uncharacteristic of a projectile.

Bomb, Young Link's third and final projectile, is perhaps his most complex and flexible. When used, Bomb functions as a held item, allowing Young Link to throw it forward, backward, up, and down, in addition to Z-dropping it, which may be used to pressure people below him or drop it and have it lie on the ground until it explodes. Bomb grants Young Link a numerous amount of trapping opportunities, such as being able to use dropped Bombs to cover platforms or ledge getup options, as well as setting up for combos if the Bomb hits an opponent.

This diverse projectile kit allow Young Link to play as a zoner, much like regular Link does. However, while most zoners' weaknesses are their poor frame data and inability to get opponents off of them, Young Link is more than capable of fighting up close and actually likes when his opponents get close to him, as it allows him to take advantage of his combo game. Speaking of combos, his last special move, Spin Attack, serves as a surprisingly effective combo starter on the ground, where it knocks opponents up into the air with weak knockback and has little endlag. Starting frame 9 and hitting on both sides, it provides a powerful out of shield option with great damage reward. In the air, it is instead a combo finisher or hard read, reliably KOing opponents at (or beyond) the ledge.

Young Link's grab game may be the best of the Links and provides him with additional options. Unlike Link, Young Link still retains use of the Hookshot for his grab, giving him a very long, disjointed grab range in exchange for his grab being laggier than unarmed grabs and thus requiring a more spacing-dependent grappling style, either grabbing at range or using turnaround grabs to create space. Additionally, the Hookshot itself can be used as a grab aerial attack. It has the longest range of any of his aerials, and can confirm in to a variety of followups, including his neutral air or up smash for KOs at higher percents. This grab aerial attack also provides him with a tether recovery, which is often much safer than his Spin Attack. His forward throw is one of the strongest forward throws in the game, KOing middleweights at the ledge of Final Destination around 130% depending on their directional influence. Some Young Link players will enjoy trying to forward-throw their oppponents very quickly before they've had a chance to DI. Young Link's grabs also have solid combo potential, as his up and down throws both provide combos at low to mid percents. His back throw is the least useful of his throws, but can set up for an edgeguard.","However, while he has some very potent strengths, Young Link has some notable weaknesses. His range, while disjointed, is significantly lacking when compared to other sword users. As a result, despite having a sword, Young Link is beaten out in range by nearly every other swordfighter in the game, causing his mid-range game to be rather poor as his attacks are too short ranged to hit but his projectiles leave him wide open to attack. Unlike other sword characters, he still needs to get up close and personal if he wants to use any attacks other than his projectiles, which leads into his second issue of his mobility.

While Young Link's mobility is average overall, this average mobility can tend to clash with his combo oriented moveset. This can lead to situations where Young Link is simply too slow to continue a combo he has started. While Fire Arrows can help alleviate this by being used to ""hold"" opponents in hitstun while Young Link gets over to continue the combo, it is not ideal or even possible in all situations. His low air speed can also limit his ability to approach or escape, making him dependent on his projectiles for setting the terms of engagement.

Additionally, Young Link's recovery, while much better than in Melee, can be exploitable. His Spin Attack, while having good reach, travels on a predictable arc and only hits to his sides, allowing him to be edgeguarded by characters who can hit his head, or be blocked by characters with counters such as Lucina. Young Link has a variety of options to deepen his recovery potential thanks to his tether recovery and many projectiles he can throw at the stage to cover himself, but in bad situations may be forced to use his up special in a way that's very vulnerable or predictable.

Young Link's KO potential can also be a mixed bag. His up smash gives him excellent kill potential out of shield, but is risky if it misses. While he has many safe moves that kill such as his neutral air, forward air, and forward tilt, they may kill quite late, often requiring the opponent to be past 150%. Young Link is very dependent on his melee hits in order to kill, challenging him to contend with his sometimes-awkward approach game and short reach. As usual, this can be mitigated with projectiles, which provide combos even at very high percents and give Young Link an opening with which to approach. Stale moves can also present challenges--moves like his nair and fair may have been heavily involved in combos and neutral, meaning they may be missing their full power when used for a KO. These factors, when combined with a large number of combos and setups to learn, cause Young Link to have a rather high learning curve, especially at top level play.","In summary, Young Link, despite featuring a very similar moveset to his alternate timeline counterparts, has a unique design and playstyle unlike anybody else in the game. He is regarded as having one of the best combo games and above average zoning tools, giving him the ability to play both hyper defensively and hyper aggressively and switch between the two playstyles on the fly to throw opponents off."
Luigi,6,6.593,"Luigi is ranked 39th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the end of B+ tier. This is a moderate drop from his high tier placement SSB4, where he was ranked 18th out of 54 characters. Similarly to his brother Mario, Luigi has excellent frame data, with low startup and ending lag on the majority of his kit, making him a very difficult character to punish. He has an outstanding air game, with one of the best jumping abilities of the roster and strong aerials with fast startup, low ending lag (except neutral and back aerials) and landing lag, and lenient auto-cancel windows, with all of them being able to auto-cancel from a short hop, and he can autocancel all of them in a short hop fast fall except for his neutral aerial. His forward and up aerials in particular have such low ending lag that he can use two forward aerials or two up aerials in a short hop and still autocancel them. Additionally, Luigi boasts incredible combo ability and solid KO power: his down throw is one of the best combo starters in the game, and allows him to either perform consistent zero-to-death combos on the vast majority of the roster or set up for a KO via Super Jump Punch, Luigi Cyclone, or a sweetspotted back aerial at high percentages. Finally, Luigi Cyclone's frame 1 invincibility when used in the air gives Luigi a reliable combo breaker.

However, Luigi still has several noticeable weaknesses. His overall mobility is sluggish, with his air speed being one of the slowest in the game. Luigi's pitifully slow air speed is an especially painful hindrance, as it makes him susceptible to juggling. Both of these weaknesses leave Luigi with a poor disadvantage state. Along with his only average grounded mobility at best, his ground game is also further brought down by his below average range, which, when combined with his aforementioned debilitating air speed and the lack of a reflector, makes it very difficult for him to fight against camping. In addition, Luigi's recovery, while long-distanced, is very predictable and linear, as Green Missile doesn't leave him helpless but only grants him horizontal distance with noticeable ending lag, while Super Jump Punch only travels straight upwards with no horizontal gain, and it also possesses very high landing lag, making him vulnerable to punishes if he fails to grab the ledge. Finally, Luigi Cyclone has lost all of its recovery and gimping potential, as the move's very high ending lag and reduced distance cause him to lose what little recovery distance he got before he can act, removing one of Luigi's strongest options off-stage.

Overall, Luigi is a polarizing character who, in the right situation, can setups for quick and unexpected KOs, but on the other hand, his weaknesses can allow opponents to take advantage of his poor mobility and predictable recovery. Although the character’s representation early on was sub par due to his rather poor disadvantage, it has since improved noticeably as his strengths became more noticeable in the competitive scene, as a result, this has allowed him to foster a good-sized playerbase spearheaded by players such as Luugi, Raru, and, prior to his ban, Elegant. Due to his top notch advantage state and Raru’s insanely high placements in major tournaments, there have been calls to reevaluate Luigi’s current position on the tier list, with many saying that he should be ranked higher.","Luigi is a middleweight whose attributes deviate from most other characters in his weight class. Luigi sports fairly average walking speed, dashing speed, and air acceleration, a decent initial dashing speed, below-average gravity, slow falling speed, low traction, the 2nd slowest air speed, and among the best jumping prowess in the roster, with the fourth highest jump and the tenth highest double jump. As a result, Luigi is quite floaty and his mobility is fairly sluggish overall, especially in the air.","Luigi's greatest asset is his outstanding frame data, which is easily among the fastest in the game. Because of this, similarly to his older brother Mario, Luigi can be very difficult to punish; only two of his standard moves and five of his attacks overall have more than 9 frames of startup lag (forward smash, down aerial, Fireball, Green Missile, and Luigi Cyclone), a multitude of his moves hit on or before frame 5 (such as his neutral attack, dash attack, neutral aerial, up aerial, and his tilts), and the vast majority of his moveset has low ending lag, granting him incredible attack speed and an excellent punish game; both points are complemented by the utility of his overall moveset. His neutral attack's damage output and range are average at best, yet its two hits can lock. Its first hit also comes out on frame 2, which makes the move a fairly useful option for warding off nearby opponents. Luigi's tilt attacks also have their own perks: his forward tilt can be angled and is useful for spacing, his up tilt has excellent combo and juggling potential, and his down tilt is an incredibly quick and highly spammable move that can combo into itself and a few other moves while also being able to consistently perform 2 frame punishes at the edge. Lastly, Luigi's dash attack has quick startup; when coupled with its reduced ending lag, increased damage output and higher knockback, it is a much better move for approaching and attacking than in previous installments.

Luigi's smash attacks are among the fastest of their kind, have below-average ending lag, and are strong enough to be reliable finishers. As a result of these traits, they allow Luigi to quickly and effectively punish opponents close to him while also rendering him being difficult to punish on shield. His forward smash deals extra shield damage, his up smash is an effective anti-air attack due to rendering his head intangible while its hitboxes are active as well as functioning as an effective out of shield option, and his down smash is very useful for punishing rolls thanks to its minimal lag, respectable damage output, and long range, with its back hit being an especially good finisher. Both Luigi's up and down smashes also have set-up potential at low percentages if he successfully covers the opponent's options afterward.

Despite his extremely poor air speed, Luigi has a fantastic set of aerial attacks, courtesy of them possessing fast startup, lenient auto-cancel windows, quick interruptibility (except for neutral and back aerials) and low ending lag in general. In terms of auto-canceling, he can auto-cancel all of his aerials with a short hop, can auto-cancel all of them except neutral aerial with a short hop fast fall, and can use his forward, up and down aerials twice with a single short hop. Lastly, he can use his forward and up aerials twice with a single short hop without suffering from landing lag. Luigi's neutral aerial is the only sex kick that consistently launches an opponent vertically, which grants it a few notable perks: the clean hitbox deals high damage and respectable knockback, making it a great combo breaker and even a situational KO option while near the upper blast line at high percentages, while both it and especially the late hitbox are very useful combo starters when used with a short hop. His forward aerial has the lowest ending lag of its kind, and launches at the Sakurai angle; at low to medium percentages, these traits make it very reliable for approaching, down throw-initiated combos into itself, his neutral aerial, and his up aerial, as well as a reliable edge-guarding option at high percentages. Luigi's back aerial has the highest ending lag of his aerials by a noticeable margin, but its minimal startup, decent range and powerful clean hitbox on his feet collectively enable it to function as a safe and reliable option for KOing, edge-guarding and (when used via a reverse aerial rush) approaching. His up aerial is useful for combos: it can either extend them or, thanks to having the lowest amount of landing lag out his aerials, use its clean hitbox to start them at low percentages when SHFF'd due to its clean hit dealing above-average damage for a combo move. Its generous auto-cancel window and very low ending lag also allow Luigi to use it twice in a single short hop and still auto-cancel it successfully, a trait it shares with his forward aerial and Little Mac's neutral aerial. Lastly, Luigi's down aerial is safe to use and has a clean hitbox which is a fast meteor smash, coming out on frame 10 and with only 18 frames of ending lag, the lowest of any meteor smash. Due to his powerful aerials with generally low lag all around, Luigi has an outstanding air game.

Luigi has an excellent grab game, but unlike in past installments, he has a tether grab due to him using the Poltergust G-00's Suction Shot to grab an opponent. As a result, Luigi can grab opponents from a fairly long distance, preventing the necessity for him to get up close to do so. It also provides Luigi with a grab aerial, in which the suction cup functions as a projectile that deals minor damage and knockback. This grants Luigi an additional edge-guarding option and deceptively useful combo option that, unlike most projectiles, cannot be absorbed or reflected. Like Mario, Luigi has an average pummel, which can deal multiple hits before being followed up with any of his useful throws. His forward throw deals respectable damage and is useful for repositioning opponents or setting up edge-guards against them at high percentages. His back throw also deals respectable damage and great knockback, allowing it to KO beginning at 120% or even earlier with rage. Unlike Mario's back throw, it also lacks a noticeably long animation, which makes it noticeably more difficult for the opponent to use directional influence to survive it. Luigi's throw deals average damage and knockback, and possesses follow-up potential into forward or up aerials at low to medium percentages, depending on the opponent's DI. It also possesses a collateral hitbox to hit bystanders. Lastly, Luigi's down throw is his primary combo starter and is one of his most useful attacks: it deals average knockback, has low ending lag, and launches at a vertical angle, which collectively enable it to lead into potent and highly damaging combos, even being able to lead into potential zero-to-death combos. His down throw can combo into moves such as his up tilt, up smash, all of his aerials, Super Jump Punch and Luigi Cyclone, due to its aforementioned traits. It also functions as an excellent setup for KOs, such as by comboing into Super Jump Punch, back aerial, or Luigi Cyclone at high percentages. Although situational, Luigi's down throw also has a collateral hitbox before the throw that can hit bystanders, similarly to his up throw.

As a pseudo-clone of Mario, Luigi has a pair of special moves that are derived from his older brother, yet his versions deviate in noticeable ways. Fireball is a projectile that is useful for pressuring, hindering an opponent's approach, or setting up an attack. Unlike Mario's Fireball, Luigi's is unaffected by gravity and undulates; these traits make it somewhat less effective at hindering an opponent's recovery attempt, but allow it to cover a consistent area horizontally and vertically. Compared to Mario's version, Luigi's Fireballs have less ending lag as well as a clean hit that deals more damage, allowing him to throw another one just 1 frame before the clean hitbox ceases. Luigi's Super Jump Punch has fast startup like Mario's, but propels him vertically instead of diagonally. By extension, it consists of a sweetspot and sourspot, instead of multiple hitboxes like Mario's. Its sweetspot boasts devastating power, which makes it a very potent punishment option, yet it is very risky because of its high ending and landing lag and its sourspot being mostly useless aside from being a niche gimping option, as it only deals 1% damage and is not safe on hit due to hasving almost no knockback whatsoever.

Aside from these, Luigi's other special moves are completely distinct from Mario's. Green Missile deals damage and covers horizontal distance, both of which can be increased thanks to its ability to be charged, giving KO potential to the fully charged version. However, it also has a one-in-ten random chance of misfiring; in this case, it becomes even stronger than the fully charged version, and travels much further. Lastly, Luigi Cyclone grants Luigi some invincibility frames on startup, enabling him to break out of combos or contest opposing attacks effectively. It also functions as a KOing option near the upper blast line, and is a guaranteed follow-up from down throw even at high percentages, which can function as a reliable KO confirm (especially on platforms).","However, Luigi has some notable disadvantages. He has fairly sluggish mobility, with his extremely slow air speed and floaty physics making it difficult for him to land onstage, especially against faster characters, thus giving him a notable weakness to juggling. His range, even compared to Mario's, is well below-average and thus he struggles to approach characters with ranged or disjointed attacks, such as Lucina and Shulk. Compared to Mario, Luigi's lack of a reflector also makes it more difficult for him to deal with projectile camping (especially against characters such as Snake, Samus, and Simon) when combined with his awkward mobility.

Additionally, Luigi's poor aerial mobility hinders his ability to approach with his aerial attacks, as well as his recovery. On top of this, his recovery, although long-distanced, is linear, slow, predictable and fairly susceptible to gimping and edgeguarding. Luigi Cyclone barely grants any additional height compared to previous games, and its very high ending lag causes him to lose the height he obtained when using it, which leaves him reliant on Super Jump Punch and Green Missile for recovering; the former travels directly upward only, and the latter has noticeable lag, cannot sweetspot edges, and relies on either charging or its random misfire chance to cover a serviceable horizontal distance.","Overall, Luigi is a very solid character, but unlike Mario, he can have a tendency to run hot and cold. His extremely fast frame data, devastating combos and strong air game and grab game collectively make him a force to be reckoned with, so long as his opponents make careless mistakes. Luigi's overall combo game, KO potential, and advantage state are easily superior to his brother's, having many different set-ups that can deal absurdly high damage within seconds, and then score KOs immediately thereafter. However, Luigi's short range, merely average grounded mobility, abysmal aerial mobility, and predictable side special and up special force him to fight at close-quarters all the time, hindering both his approach and recovery. Because of this, a mastery of Luigi's recovery mix-ups and powerful combo game is crucial to achieving success with him."
Captain Falcon,7,6.441,"Captain Falcon is ranked 40th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the top of the B- tier. This is a moderate drop from his 19th out of 54 placement in SSB4. Captain Falcon retains his speed and mobility from previous games, which allow him to rush down his opponent with ease and combo them or carry them off into the blast line. Captain Falcon's normals, such as his neutral aerial are useful as they open up combos or KO setups into his forward aerial, back aerial, or down aerial. Additionally, Captain Falcon's back aerial, down aerial, and forward aerial make him potent offstage. Captain Falcon has little to no trouble KOing his opponent with a plethora of powerful moves, such as up smash, sweetspotted forward aerial, back aerial, Falcon Kick, and Falcon Dive. Captain Falcon's special moves also saw some improvement. Raptor Boost became one of Captain Falcon's main combo starters, Falcon Dive is a solid out of shield option, and Falcon Kick was buffed to be a faster KO move.

Despite all these strengths, Falcon has prevalent weaknesses for a character of his archetype. His tall stature and high fall speed makes him easy to combo for most of the cast and his recovery is linear enough to where most characters can easily edgeguard him. This results in Falcon having problematic matchups with characters above him on the tier list. Captain Falcon also has an issue where his hurtbox will extend when turning around after a dash, which causes him to get clipped by many moves that are slightly miss-spaced. Finally, due to his lack of a projectile and a reliable spacing option, Captain Falcon is usually forced to approach in most matchups, which puts him at risk of losing neutral.

Overall, Falcon remains a high-risk high-reward fighter with a solid punish game overall. Falcon has seen respectable tournament results from players such as Jogibu, Karaage and prior to his retirement, Fatality.","Captain Falcon is a tall heavyweight character, yet he boasts some of the best overall mobility out of any character in spite of his weight class. Captain Falcon sports the 2nd fastest dashing speed, the 7th fastest falling speed, the 11th fastest air speed, and the 14th highest gravity. His jumps and wall jumps are also very high. Strangely, though, his walking speed is rather slow, while his traction and air acceleration are around average. Additionally, while his running speed is very high, his initial dash speed is only slightly above average, and crucially he hits this lower limit during his initial dash a few frames before transitioning to his running animation, making his effective movement speed in short bursts lower than expected. Compounding this is his turnaround dash animation, which causes him to slide in the opposite direction for a few frames, before sliding back into his origin location. While his high run acceleration can mask this to an extent, this effectively results in him making no progress in the direction he is turning into for several frames, resulting in his retreat being counter-intuitively one of the least safe in the game, especially when combined with his legs extending a long distance behind him. Nonetheless, his high mobility overall, combined with his strong punish game and generally low landing lag on his aerials, benefits him with a trademark speed-and-power combo.","Despite lacking a projectile, Falcon has an overall effective neutral game, courtesy of his mobility. His primary combo starter is grounded Raptor Boost; its low knockback along with its vertical launching angle and low ending lag make it a fearsome combo starter if landed, allowing it to combo into a plentiful number of moves. Neutral aerial can chain into itself at low percents, and Falcon can combo it into his other aerials if he lands with the first hit. His up tilt consistently meteor smashes opponents even if they are grounded, making it not only a great combo tool, but a decent edgeguarding tool as well. One of his best combo tools is his up aerial; at a wide range of percents, it can create incredibly long chains, especially into itself due to its low base knockback and overall low lag. Alternatively, Falcon can chain his up aerial into some of his deadliest finishers, most notably into his forward aerial, the Knee Smash.

Captain Falcon, like most of his fellow medium-heavyweights also boasts excellent KO power. He also has a formidable edgeguarding ability. His up and down smashes are both excellent baiting options due to their low ending lag, making them safe on shield and potentially even on whiff. Even if they both have rather noticeable startup, they are also long enough to punish spot dodges reliably. His up smash in particular even functions as a situational combo starter at low percentages, which can allow Falcon to deal insane amounts of damage in just a few measly hits. While his forward smash is his least useful smash attack as a whole, even it has its uses, being a powerful KO option that can be angled. His forward, back, and down aerials all deal high knockback, with his forward aerial in particular being the strongest of its type in the entire game. His down tilt, while having noticeable startup, sends at a semi-spike angle with high knockback, and it has low ending lag, making it not only a good spacing and poking tool, but also a great edgeguarding and KO move, the lattermost quirk being extremely rare for a down tilt.

Falcon's special moveset also has its uses. Falcon Punch, while being extremely situational in the long run, is one of the strongest neutral specials in the entire game, especially when reversed on the ground, and is perfect for punishing shield breaks. As mentioned earlier, Raptor Boost is an excellent combo starter on the ground. In the air, it has the potential to meteor smash, and it also serves well as a KO move in such cases. Falcon Dive is one of the strongest command grabs in the game, and while it is linear, it does cover a decent amount of distance. It also works well as a combo finisher and out-of-shield option due to its high knockback and being a command grab. Finally, Falcon Kick is effective in terms of dealing with pressure due to its speed and long-lasting hitbox, and it also possesses decent KO power when hit early on. It is also an excellent tool for returning to the stage quickly when used in the air.","However, Captain Falcon does have his fair share of weaknesses. While he is a powerhouse, most of his KO moves are difficult to land, the most prominent examples being his forward smash and Falcon Punch. His forward aerial is faster than those moves, but even then it suffers from a rather small sweetspot that lasts for only one frame, making it hard to land without an air dodge read or setup off of an up aerial. As a result, he often has to rely on edgeguarding to score KOs. Though his neutral game is good overall, his lack of a projectile leaves him susceptible to camping. While his above average weight and fast falling speed give him excellent endurance, they also leave him vulnerable to combos, which is further exacerbated by the fact that he has little to no fast options with which to break them.

Falcon's moveset in general is also full of issues. As mentioned earlier, most of his KO moves are slow and tough to land, which forces him to rely on edgeguarding to KO effectively. Falcon Kick is extremely unsafe offstage due to its lag and Falcon's fast falling speed, as it is not unlikely for him to self-destruct with it. While Raptor Boost can meteor smash in the air, it will leave him helpless if he misses, which could also result in a self-destruct. Other examples of unreliability within his moveset lie in his neutral aerial and up smash, both of which tend to have trouble connecting properly at high percentages. His overall range, while not necessarily lacking for a brawler, is also lackluster when compared to other characters with good physical reach, especially due to the fact that he lacks a projectile.

While Captain Falcon has a good ground game and an excellent air game, his grab game is rather mediocre. To begin with, his grab range is overall somewhat short despite his height, making it risky to throw out. His down throw remains a useful combo starter at low to medium percents, but has lost its utility as a semi-guarenteed setup into Knee Smash due to its knockback and angle adjustments. While Captain Falcon's back throw remains a useful KO move, his forward throw has lost its decent combo potential as an indirect consequence of his much higher traction, just like Meta Knight's forward throw. Although it remains a serviceable KO move, it is utterly outclassed by back throw in this regard. Captain Falcon's up throw suffers from similar issues to his forward throw: it has too much ending lag to combo properly, even in spite of his faster jumpsquat, and it is somewhat weak for a KO throw despite dealing more damage than in Smash 4.

Captain Falcon's biggest flaw is his recovery: despite his impressive air speed, his two recovery options, Falcon Dive and Raptor Boost, are linear, easily intercepted, and have small edge sweetspots. Raptor Boost also doesn't have a hitbox above him, which can leave him open to meteor smashes, which he usually has trouble surviving due to his linear recovery and fast falling speed. To his merit, he can reuse Falcon Dive if it connects with an opponent, and even stage spike them, though this is easily teched. Furthermore, since all characters can wall jump out of a tech, opponents can punish Falcon as he leaps back, possibly putting him in a worse offstage situation. In addition, while Falcon Dive covers an alarmingly high amount of horizontal distance due to its high drift, its vertical travel distance is quite mild, and Raptor Boost also renders him helpless, making it situational when combined with its poor travel distance. Although he has the second-best wall jump in the game, Falcon will be in danger offstage without his double jump.","Overall, Captain Falcon is the epitome of a hit & run character, yet also benefits from a bait and punish playstyle; when combining his excellent mobility and combo game, he can string very long combos for huge amounts of damage. Otherwise, if he can use his KO moves wisely, he does not have much trouble scoring KOs. However, his flaws are quite susceptible to be punished easily if the player is not careful due to Captain Falcon's susceptibility to combos and exploitable recovery. He also falls under the bait and punish archetype, requiring to have a very precise and patient gameplay style in order to take advantage of the opponent's mistakes to score KO's."
Pit,7,6.396,"Pit, alongside his Echo Fighter Dark Pit, are ranked 41st out of 82 on the current tier list, placing them in the B- tier. This is a slight improvement over their 32nd out of 54 placement in SSB4. Dark Pit, alongside his base fighter Pit, are ranked 41st out of 82 on the current tier list, placing them in the B- tier. This is a slight rise for them compared to their 32nd out of 54 placement in SSB4.","Pit is a middleweight who has above-average walking and dashing speeds, a fast initial dash, very high traction (being tied with his Echo Fighter for the 2nd highest behind Sonic), average air acceleration and falling speed, and below-average air speed and gravity. Pit's jump and double jump are both low, although this flaw is largely offset by his 3 double jumps. These attributes render Pit's overall mobility as average, yet make him adept at adapting to most situations. Dark Pit is Pit's Echo Fighter, and he is very similar to his counterpart as well. His mobility is completely identical, sharing the same walking speed, dashing speed, air speed, falling speed and three double jumps. Similarly, Dark Pit's standard attacks are all identical to Pit's, sharing the exact same frame data, hitboxes, damage and knockback, with only three attacks in his entire moveset having different attributes (two special attacks and his Final Smash). A Pit player will have no trouble playing Dark Pit or vice versa because of their mirrored movesets, but the slight differences the two possess can make Dark Pit a better or worse choice in a matchup.","As a beginner-friendly character, Pit has a low learning curve, yet is quite rewarding when played wisely. His ease of use is probably best exemplified by his fast frame data; aside from six moves (forward tilt, forward smash, and forward/back/up/down aerials), the rest of Pit's standard moveset has less than 10 frames of startup lag. Much like his attributes, Pit's moveset is balanced, so much so that it seemingly has no glaring strengths or weaknesses. When coupled with his great neutral game, Pit's edgeguarding potential, punishment ability, and conversions are all balanced compared to the rest of the cast. Pit's ground game overall possesses a decent level of utility. Neutral attack, down tilt and down smash are decent spacing options, thanks to their quick start-up and moderate ending lag in proportion to their range, with down tilt also serving as a useful combo starter unlike in SSB4 in addition to making Pit pseudo-crawl.

Neutral attack's first two hits can jab lock, while dash attack can punish landings and whiffed attacks very effectively, and down smash's back hit is a moderately strong semi-spike. Up tilt and especially up smash are useful anti-air moves, with the former being viable for setting up juggles even at higher percentages, while the latter also boasts enough power to score KOs. Lastly, forward smash is Pit's strongest KOing option, and it has among the fastest startup of any forward smash in the game.

Pit possesses a respectable grab game. Forward throw can combo into dash attack at low percentages or KO at high percentages while near the edge, while down throw can be used to combo into up smash or any of his aerials. Back throw can combo into a dash attack at low percentages as well and can be used to setup edgeguards at higher percentages. Finally, up throw is Pit's most damaging, yet least useful throw, since its only utility is to occasionally set up juggles or pressure.

Pit's air game is also useful, thanks to his aerial attacks' ability to all autocancel in a short hop and their particular strengths. Neutral aerial has the lowest amount of startup lag out of his entire moveset, a long duration, and an excellent autocancel window. Altogether, these traits make it a decent out of shield option, decent for edgeguarding and approaching, and similarly to Palutena's neutral aerial, it is also useful for pressure and combos. Forward and up aerials are reliable followups from down throw, the latter more so at mid to high percentages; in addition, the former is useful for approaching and edgeguarding, whereas the latter is excellent for juggling. Back aerial is Pit's strongest aerial attack when sweetspotted, making it ideal for spacing as well as for outright KOing. Lastly, down aerial has the lowest ending lag of Pit's aerials, and is useful for edgeguarding thanks to it being a meteor smash during its first frame, and its fairly large range also makes it decent for approaching; the inability to tech grounded meteor smashes in Ultimate also enables down aerial to serve as a combo starter at higher percents that can combo into an up smash for a reliable KO combo. It's also fast for a meteor smash, coming out on frame 10. Pit's aerial attacks also have low landing lag.

Pit's special moves are fairly versatile as well, reinforcing his ease of use. He has a great projectile in Palutena Bow which moves quickly, can be charged and easily maneuvered makes it very useful for camping, edgeguarding, winning projectile wars against characters such as Simon, and even mindgames. Upperdash Arm functions very similarly to Raptor Boost: it propels Pit forward and, upon making contact with something, results in him throwing an uppercut that has a decent damage output and very high base knockback, and can KO at high percentages. Upperdash Arm also has utility outside of offense; it grants super armor, can reflect projectiles, and can function as a horizontal recovery option. However, it is very punishable because of its dash's noticeable startup lag and extreme amount of ending lag, especially when it misses. Upperdash Arm's deflection property is also fairly inconsequential, since it reflects projectiles at an upward diagonal angle instead of directly back at the opponent. Power of Flight covers an impressive amount of distance, and be angled to propel Pit either vertically, diagonally, or almost horizontally; it also grants Pit brief intangibility on startup as well. Lastly, Guardian Orbitars protect Pit on his left and right sides with energy shields that reflect projectiles. They are also capable of pushing opponents back, which makes them capable of edgeguarding. However, the Orbitars are not indestructible: should they end up being destroyed, they cannot be used again for 10 seconds. In addition, their high amount of ending lag makes them highly risky when used on the ground or when landing. The only major differences lie in Dark Pit's special moves. The first is Dark Pit's Silver Bow: compared to Pit's Palutena's Bow, Silver Bow's arrows travel in a straight trajectory and can be only shifted slightly up and down. Their limited movement grant them significantly less utility overall, especially in regards to ""sniping"" offstage opponents and gimping them. Instead, they possess higher overall damage, increased knockback, and faster speed when uncharged, which make them more rewarding when used as a more conventional projectile. They can also KO offstage opponents if charged up. In essence, Dark Pit's arrows are more effective as a standard projectile or on opponents who are in a disadvantageous state, but offer significantly less utility otherwise.

The second is his side special, Electroshock Arm. Compared to Pit's Upperdash Arm, Electroshock Arm is more effective due to its higher damage, electric hitbox (which makes it safer on shield), and altered knockback; given its horizontal trajectory, it sends at an effective edgeguarding angle, and is a powerful tool for KOing especially at the edges of a stage (where it can do so as early as 80%). Whereas the vertical trajectory of Upperdash Arm allows it to set up juggles and KO consistently anywhere on the stage, and its angle also makes it capable of KOing moderately early on stages with low ceilings, Electroshock Arm instead sees more utility as a surprise KOing and edgeguarding tool; Upperdash Arm is mostly limited to setting up juggles until KO percents instead, rendering it somewhat inferior for KOing compared to Electroshock Arm.

All in all, in line with Dark Pit's Idol description in Uprising, the ""flawed clone of Pit"" is a more difficult character to use projectile-wise due to his stronger, inaccurate projectile, but brings a different finishing tool in the form of Electroshock Arm, which can grant him opportunities to net KOs in the form of hard punishes. Nevertheless, Dark Pit's differences from Pit are not all that significant (similarly to fellow Echo Fighters Daisy, Richter and Dark Samus), and it is largely up to the player to decide whether to use Pit or Dark Pit during battle, since both are traditional ""all-rounders"" with a more notable preference towards edgeguarding and recovery.
","Despite his strengths, Pit does have some weaknesses. Like any all-around character, most characters are able to outperform him in various areas: as examples, Mario himself has a significantly more versatile combo game, Fox has better mobility, Olimar and Snake are better at camping, Shulk has much greater range, and R.O.B. has much stronger attacks. Pit's KO potential, however, is his most noticeable weakness, despite being buffed in the transition to Ultimate. Despite possessing a serviceable amount of KOing options, only his forward smash and up smash are consistently effective, and even these are highly unsafe on shield due to their high ending lag. In comparison, his other KOing options are only effective when sweetspotted (forward tilt and back aerial), or above 130% (dash attack, down aerial, down smash, forward throw and Upperdash Arm). This, in turn, is further compounded by his lack of guaranteed KO setups outside of sweetspotted down aerial into up smash or forward smash.

Although rage somewhat alleviates Pit's KO potential, his average endurance means that he cannot utilize it as consistently or effectively as heavier characters can. As a result, Pit will typically spend a comparatively longer time racking up damage before attempting to score a KO, and will often give the opponent high amounts of rage in the process.

Although all of Pit's aerials autocancel in a short hop, only his forward and back aerials autocancel during a short hop buffered fast fall. This means that Pit players will often need to manually delay their fast fall perfectly in order to use his aerials effectively.

Pit's slow air speed, average falling speed and low gravity make him somewhat floaty and he noticeably struggles to both land and contest other aerial opponents due to neutral air and forward air's small looping hitboxes, and they both have glaring blindspots, not fully covering his bow as it spins, the former only hits at very close range and they are both poor defensively due to their lack of range. In the end, Pit's aerials are helpful in his advantage state and supplement his grounded neutral game, but are much less useful when he is disadvantaged. To make this issue even worse, he has only one aerial which comes out before frame 10, which is his frame 4 neutral aerial, while his back, up, and down aerials come out on frame 10, and his forward aerial at frame 11, being the slowest startup of his entire moveset. Due to his aerials being unable to properly cover him, and his floaty nature, Pit is vulnerable to pressure, as he lacks reliable ways to escape pressure or to defend himself from juggles. While his down aerial is overall fast, especially for a meteor smash, and has good range, he cannot be overly reliant on that to get out of disadvantage, and Palutena Bow, while versatile, needs a long time to be used effectively. This gives Pit a poor disadvantage state overall.

Although long-distanced, Pit's recovery is linear and predictable, and Power of Flight also does not provide Pit with protective hitboxes around him either while its intangibility period is very brief, which can leave him vulnerable to sufficiently strong meteor smashes. Additionally, while Upperdash Arm can aid Pit's horizontal recovery, it has an extreme amount of ending lag when performed in the air, making it extremely risky when improperly used as a recovery option.","All in all, Pit's strengths outweigh his weaknesses. His moveset consists of many moves with long range (his grounded moves and back aerial), long durations (neutral/forward/up aerials and forward tilt), low ending lag (autocanceled neutral/forward aerials, down smash and Palutena Bow) or quick movement (dash attack, dash grab and Upperdash Arm). This combination of traits, along with his good grounded mobility, allows Pit to reliably keep opponents in a disadvantage state, either stuck trying to land or getting off the edge.

In the end, he can cover enough options and retain advantage long enough to rack up good amounts of damage. However, he suffers from unimpressive KO potential similarly to lightweights, yet lacks the extended combo options and safe pressuring options that they typically possess for damage-racking.

Despite being a very balanced character, players often tend to overlook Pit in favor of other characters that possess much more outstanding strengths than he does. This has also been reflected in his tournament representation, which is minimal outside of Japan, much like in SSB4. However, Pit has nevertheless managed to achieve an adequate level of success in the competitive scene, although not as much as in SSB4: Kuro in particular has done well with Pit, with him placing 3rd at Umebura SP. Pit has also received results from others like KiraFlax. Much like Pit, Dark Pit's results and representation have not been particularly impressive compared to many other characters."
Byleth,7,6.371,"Byleth is ranked 42nd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B- tier.","Byleth is a tall, middleweight swordsman, yet has poor overall mobility (similarly to Ganondorf, Incineroar and Dr. Mario), high startup and ending lag on many of his moves, and a rather short grab range. In the words of Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai, Byleth is a ""distance demon"",[1] since his optimal playstyle involves using his Heroes' Relics to zone out opponents at mid-range, similarly to Marth and Shulk. Thanks to his variety of weapons, Byleth's overall range is fittingly long in line with his archetype, and his attacks are generally very strong, especially for a middleweight, although this comes at the cost of his frame data being rather sluggish. All of these traits make Byleth's general gameplan very patient: his sluggishness and strength make it important for him to plan ahead and learn the opponent's habits before covering their options with his range and arsenal of hard-hitting weapons.","Like other weapon wielders, Byleth's attacks have disjointed hitboxes that allow him to fight effectively from a safe distance. Neutral attack is a quick chain of attacks that help ward off nearby opponents, and is useful due to being his fastest attack of any kind. Due to having four weapons, each of them is assigned to different attacking directions. Like in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, the Sword of the Creator is Byleth's default weapon, and it is wielded throughout all animations that do not involve any other weapon.

Neutral infinite is one of the most damaging of its kind in the entire game, and it can even KO at very high percentages while near the edge. Up and forward tilts have wide hitboxes and decent speed, making them effective spacing attacks. Down tilt transforms the Sword of the Creator into its whip form, and although it is slower than the other two tilts, it is a useful combo starter into aerial attacks. Dash attack is a wide slash forward that is potent for punishing whiffs, and can even KO at reasonable percentages when its blade hitbox connects. However, its ending lag makes it easily punishable, which is further compounded by its weak hilt hitbox.

In regard to an assigned attack direction, all of Byleth's up-inputted moves emphasize the Sword of the Creator's whip form. Up smash causes him to lash upwards in a flurry, which deals multiple hits and is useful for denying landings or starting juggles. It is also Byleth's fastest smash attack, while its moderately powerful final hit makes it a viable KO option as well. Up aerial functions very similarly to up smash in regard to aesthetics and mechanics. Due to being an aerial, however, its looping hits can also drag opponents downward to initiate extended combos, which makes it one of Byleth's most useful attacks in general.

When used as his up special, the Sword of the Creator grants Byleth a very long tether recovery that can grab Battlefield's edges, even if he is near the bottom blast line. Notably, Byleth's up special can attach to walls and enable him to perform a wall jump if he then touches a wall, much like how tether recoveries function in Super Smash Bros. Melee. However, the Sword of the Creator also boasts potent offensive potential as an up special: it causes an untechable meteor smash at high percentages that, if used on offstage opponents, sees Byleth meteor smash an opponent by footstool jumping on them, which can cause an unavoidable KO at high percentages. This hop also has extremely low ending lag, allowing for certain follow-ups, such as his side special or even down aerial. Altogether, these traits provide Byleth with a safe array of covering various approach options.

Byleth's other weapons grant more specialized options. Areadbhar, a lance, is used for Byleth's side-inputted moves (forward smash, forward aerial, back aerial, and side special). It has long-range and has a tipper that deals more damage at the tip of the lance. Forward smash is a slow, but long-ranged stab that deals more knockback if aimed upward and tippered, allowing it to heavily punish jump options. If aimed downward, Areadbhar can also hit opponents grabbing edges. Meanwhile, forward and back aerials are very effective spacing moves, even outranging those of Marth, and their tippers deal heavy knockback.

Byleth's side special has him swing Areadbhar in a slow, but wide swing, and allows him to step forward if it is inputted like a smash attack. Its massive hitbox easily denies jump options and acts as a powerful but risky spacing option, as any character can punish it even when fully spaced if they shield it. Aside from its offensive potential, Areadbhar can even assist Byleth's horizontal recovery when used as a side special in the air. All of Areadbhar's moves are weak if the hilt lands, so proper spacing is vital; the sourspots of forward and back aerials can be used to combo or tech chase effectively, but will KO less readily. Side special will be extremely weak if the hilt lands, but Byleth will be able to shield to protect themselves even if the hilt is used.

Aymr, an axe, is used for Byleth's down-inputted moves (down smash, down aerial, and down special). It is an extremely slow, yet powerful weapon that deals high damage, shield damage, and knockback on each move that uses it. Down smash is slow overall, but hits very hard and can KO as early as 90%. Down aerial is a similarly slow swing downwards with extreme landing lag, but it is the strongest meteor smash in the game when it lands, making it also among the most rewarding. Byleth's down special causes him to charge Aymr in a super armored stance before unleashing a powerful, Special Zoom-inducing swing. It allows Byleth to pass through platforms and turn around in the opposite direction while charging, which can be used for mindgames. It also has a surprisingly wide hitbox that starts behind Byleth's head. Altogether, these traits make it a high-risk, high reward move that can catch opponents by surprise. If used in the air, it will be slightly weaker and lack super armor, yet still KO at very reasonable percentages.

Finally, Failnaught is a bow that is used for two of Byleth's neutral-inputted moves (neutral aerial and neutral special). Neutral aerial involves Byleth spinning it in a circular motion for a fairly long time, much like Pit's neutral aerial. As a result, it is a good option out of shield due to its fast startup, and can also initiate combos or edgeguard with its looping hits and landing hitbox. Byleth's neutral special uses Failnaught to fire an arrow, which can be shot at two different strengths: a slow but strong arrow that acts it serviceable for sniping and spacing, or a very delayed arrow that is one of fastest projectiles in the game and is strong enough almost break a full shield. The charged arrow also becomes an energy projectile, making it possible to absorb it, though it cannot be Inhaled or Pocketed. Unlike other bows, Byleth can charge-cancel Failnaught, specifically up until slightly after the delayed charged arrow begins charging. However, he is unable to cancel it after he reaches that point. Byleth's neutral special can also turn around up to two times before the charged arrow is fired, similarly to Palutena Bow/Silver Bow.","Byleth may have good strengths, but he does also have weaknesses. Due to his overall mobility being among the worst in Ultimate, his approach is very committal. This flaw is further compounded by many of his attacks having slow startup (e.g. down smash/down aerial), narrow hitbox placements (e.g. forward/back aerials), or even both (e.g. forward smash). Dash attack, neutral aerial, and side special are exceptions, but are easily punishable on shield due to their ending lag, while the lattermost is dangerously unsafe if the sweetspot does not connect.

This flaw becomes even more dangerous with Failnaught's unique charge properties: while the arrows fired from it are powerful and fast, they are equally as dangerous if reflected, as Byleth cannot cancel the move after charging it halfway through. Byleth's abundance of powerful attacks is also a double-edged sword: while these attacks make it easy for him to heavily punish mistakes, his sluggish frame data also makes counterattacks an excellent option to punish his many KO options if they are used unwisely.

Byleth's grab game is also lackluster at best. Down throw is, by far, the best aspect of Byleth's grab game: it is a reliable combo starter below 80%, with neutral, forward and back aerials being reliable follow-ups. However, this is offset by the other aspects of his grab game. Aside from his aforementioned grab range issues, his pummel is akin to a heavyweight's by being decently damaging, yet fairly slow. Up throw is his most damaging throw, but inflicts only a mediocre 9% and its only real purpose is applying pressure from below, with up aerial and up special being possible follow-ups if the opponent fails to DI properly. Although back throw can potentially combo into dash attack at low percentages, this combo is utterly outclassed by down throw's combos. Instead, it and forward throw are used primarily to launch the opponent offstage.

Byleth's recovery is also burdensome in certain ways. Due to being a tether recovery, his up special boasts high vertical distance, but lackluster horizontal distance. When coupled with his poor air speed, Byleth is susceptible to gimps. However, his recovery is deceptively useful when used properly. Since up special can recover from halfway between the camera border and blast zone on Final Destination, Byleth mostly has to worry about getting in range horizontally. To assist with this, he can use his side special or his neutral/forward/back/up aerials to hit away opponents, and performing a B-reversed Failnaught charge, canceled with a jump, which will make where Byleth is going to be very hard for the opponent to guess.","All in all, Byleth is a ranged powerhouse that boasts a capable mixture of highly damaging attacks, KO options, combos, and setups. However, Byleth's slow overall mobility and poor overall frame data mean that he must be careful with his offensive techniques and use his tools very patiently in order to punish his opponent's mistakes, as a careless move on Byleth's end will easily give his opponent just as big of an opening to retaliate."
Rosalina & Luma,7,6.364,"Rosalina & Luma are currently ranked 43rd out of 82 characters in the B- tier, placing them in the center of the higher end of mid tier. This is a a drastic drop from their 5th out of 54 placement in SSB4. Rosalina & Luma are notable for their tag team mechanic, which grants Rosalina the ability to control Luma almost anywhere on the stage, giving her access to advanced techniques such as the Lunar Landing. Together, their attacks possess disjointed range, allowing them to wall out stubby characters.

Luma also can function as a shield of sorts, as it does not share Rosalina's damage meter. Rosalina herself has a very effective aerial game, very flexible aerial movement thanks to her high air acceleration, and a strong juggling option in the form of her up aerial. Finally, her recovery is long and flexible thanks to Launch Star's quick speed and long travel distance, while Gravitational Pull allows her to deal with characters who try camping her out with projectiles.

However, Rosalina & Luma have some significant flaws. Luma's endurance is hindered by its inability to act out of a tumble and its lack of defensive options, such as shielding and rolling. Without Luma, Rosalina's attacks are noticeably weaker and possess less generous hitbox placements, and she loses access to some of her techniques and two of her special moves. In addition, Rosalina's disadvantage state is poor due to her tall stature, low gravity, and slow falling speed, while her light weight makes her susceptible to early KOs. Finally, Rosalina & Luma often have difficulty playing against characters that have better disjoints and/or can outrange their attacks.

Overall, Rosalina & Luma's strengths rely on understanding how to make the most use out of their unique mechanic, which leads to a high learning curve. Despite having below-average representation in the current metagame, Rosalina & Luma continue to see success from players such as Dabuz, Homika, and yuzu.","Rosalina is a tall and floaty lightweight, much like Mewtwo, and Zelda. Rosalina is tied with Falco for being the 14th lightest character in the game; unlike Peach or Zelda, however, her overall grounded mobility is decent, thanks to her above-average initial dashing speed and slightly above-average walking and dashing speeds. Rosalina has average air speed, the 2nd highest additional air acceleration values in the game (tied with Mega Man and surpassed only by Palutena), and both her jump and double jump have significant height. Additionally, her falling and fast falling speeds are among the slowest, while her gravity is the 2nd lowest in the game. Lastly, the combination of Rosalina's high jump height, low gravity and slow falling speed give her the longest jump duration among the cast, allowing her more than 1 second (71 frames) in the air with an uninterrupted full hop. As a result of these attributes, Rosalina is a very floaty character with superb aerial mobility and the ability to remain airborne longer than most other characters in the game.","Due to being allied with Luma, Rosalina also follows the tag team archetype established by the Ice Climbers and perpetuated by Olimar. Luma can remain next to Rosalina to attack with her, or it can be sent away with Luma Shot to attack from a distance. This allows Rosalina numerous possibilities to attack opponents, as she can essentially create combos by ""pinballing"" opponents back and forth between herself and Luma. This ability also grants Rosalina the largest and most unique range in the roster, as Luma can attack from across stage or far above/below while Rosalina remains safely out of harm's way.

Luma mechanically functions like a blend of Pikmin and the Ice Climbers' partner climber: it uses hit points (HP) like the Pikmin, in which it will be KO'd if it is dealt 40%, and it responds to player inputs like the partner Ice Climber. Unlike Olimar, Rosalina cannot immediately summon Luma once it is KO'd, which forces her to wait 10 seconds (7 seconds if 3 players are present, and 5 seconds if 4 or more players are present) until another Luma appears. Luma also cannot experience status effects, such as stun or sleep, which can allow it to attack and/or fend off opponents if Rosalina happens to find herself put under a status effect that renders her unable to move or attack. Luma also cannot be grabbed, and is able to act when Rosalina herself does get grabbed.

While they are largely defensive characters, Rosalina & Luma have several offensive options that allow them to rack up damage if given the opportunity. They have many attacks with disjointed hitboxes, most notably each of Rosalina's aerials, which are also very useful for racking up damage. Their neutral aerial is a fast, low commitment option with upwards knockback, perfectly complimenting their aerial and juggling oriented fighting style. Her forward aerial keeps the opponent in place, hits multiple times, and combos well with her down throw like Ness' same combo. Despite having a large multi-hitting hitbox, it has the longest amount of landing lag out of her aerials and is generally unsafe on shield. Her and Luma's back aerials are quick semi-spikes and can be used in a wide range of scenarios, such as edge-guarding and spacing. Their up aerial is a capable attack, as it possesses outstanding disjointed range and can KO off the top of some stages when used properly. Although their slowest, down aerial is also a very potent edge-guarding option: Rosalina's hitbox is very large, hard to challenge from below due to its duration, and capable of meteor smashing, whereas Luma's hitbox can easily KO outright thanks to its very high knockback growth and sending opponents directly outward.

Rosalina also has access to a unique advanced technique called Lunar Landing. If Rosalina inputs an aerial attacks right as she lands, the aerial will not come out and she will land without enduring any landing lag (Unless using down aerial), but Luma will continue performing its respective aerial attack. This allows for greater mix-up and follow-up potential, as well as mindgames, but requires Luma in order to actually be performed. Their dash grab also has a similar occurrence, where if Rosalina performs a dash attack and instantly grabs, Rosalina will perform a dash grab while Luma will perform its respective dash attack. This makes their dash grab a lot safer, and means they can deal an extra 3% just by landing the grab. Rosalina can also use Lunar Landing to access her advantage state by inputting Luma's respective back aerial or forward aerial as she lands which gives her the ability to clang the Lunar Landing with various projectiles or grounded moves without Rosalina herself having any ending lag, giving her an easier time landing back on stage and also providing a consistent option for her to punish certain attacks and even projectiles. When coupled with Rosalina's reliable set of throws, these traits give her and Luma even greater mix-up potential, as well as more approaching and punishing options. Using the attack canceling feature built into Ultimate's mechanics, Rosalina can perform one move while Luma does a tilt or dash attack. This also allows for multiple combos and mindgames.

Rosalina's throws possess a variety of useful increments that she can effectively utilize to set up into punishes or direct follow-ups. This produces convenient methods for her to grant a great deal of damage to her opponent very early into a stock. Rosalina's up throw constructively acts as her main combo throw which allows for exceedingly effective setups for combos into various attacks that can either combo into each other or other moves allowing for great utilization of setups into a wide variety of methods to output damage. Rosalina can consistently use her up throw to combo into her and Luma's neutral aerial, up tilt, and up aerial. This allows for Rosalina to find easy methods to rack up damage with her up throw to set up further combos or juggle her opponents with her neutral aerial or up aerial. Her forward throw is a potent tool for setting up edge-guarding when throwing an opponent off the edge or it can act as KO throw when used at the edge at very high percentages. Her forward throw even obtains further use with it allowing her to throw her opponent into a detethered Luma's attacks, effectively being able to use her forward throw to ""pinball"" her opponent at lower percentages. Her back throw is most commonly used as her primary KO throw when at higher percentages, although it can provide an opportunity to edge trap or edge-guard the opponent if it is used on the edge. However, her down throw, due to its high base knockback and ending lag, is the least useful of her throws and has very limited combo potential, as it can only potentially combo into her forward aerial at very low percentages.

Rosalina and Luma can obtain numerous uses with their tilt attacks primarily when Luma is detethered from Rosalina with the use of Luma Shot. This makes it so that the duo's tilt attacks can be used as a measure to tactfully place Rosalina into advantage state if she uses a detethered Luma's to cover the stage, with any of Luma's tilt attacks being able to effective place an opponent out of advantage state and possibly giving Rosalina the opportunity to escape a situation where she is stuck in disadvantage, greatly strengthening her defensive capabilities. Rosalina has quick startup on both her forward tilt and down tilt as well as notable range on both moves especially when combined with Luma's. Specifically, their forward tilt allows them to use its range as a poking tool or to knock opponents forward and set up tech-chasing at lower percentages. Rosalina's down tilt can set up for tech-chasing at mid-percentages and can effectively ledgetrap certain characters. Luma's down tilt obtains noteworthy range both when attached and detached to Rosalina's and it can act as a combo finisher, poking tool, and Rosalina can use it gimp certain recoveries if Luma's down tilt is used while it is detethered from Rosalina at the ledge or offstage. Rosalina and Luma's up tilt is not only an effective combo starting tool but even a decent combo extender, primarily into allowing a follow-up into their any of their aerials, and their up tilt can act as a useful anti-air. Luma's respective up tilt can hit opponents when they are both grounded and in the air, with Luma's up tilt even being a functional move to KO grounded opponents at high percentages.

Rosalina & Luma are also gifted with a good set of smash attacks. Their forward smash possesses a large amount of range, making it very useful to finish off opponents. While it has the highest knockback growth out of Rosalina's attacks, it requires Luma's involvement to achieve its true KO potential and range, which is among the best in the game. Their up smash has minimal start-up and, while it possesses less range, is still a great KOing option regardless due to rendering Rosalina's head intangible throughout its duration. Lastly, their down smash is a useful anti-pressure option thanks to it having less start-up and especially ending lag in comparison to their other smashes. Due to it also being a semi-spike, it can also be used for edge-guarding. As of update 13.0.0, it is strong enough to KO reliably, which further bolsters its utility. Luma can also perform smash attacks while away from Rosalina; thus, in a scenario where it is not safe to approach the opponent to KO, Rosalina still can attempt to KO by sending Luma out.

Rosalina and Luma's special moves give them special utility inaccesible to any other character. Luma Shot gives Rosalina a method to attack safely from a distace and gives them superior ledge guarding capabilities. Star Bits, their side special move, is a very good tool for keeping opponents away from. It cannot be clanked with and has long lasting hitboxes, allowing it to stop fast approaches like a Sonic Spin Dash. When used properly, Rosalina is practically immune to projectiles via Gravitational Pull. While it does not deal damage, it causes Rosalina to completely nullify any projectile near her. Despite not being a reflector, it shares the same ability of making incoming items and projectiles come under Rosalina's ownership, which means any opponents can be damaged by the orbiting item or projectile if they are too close. In addition, Gravitational Pull activates on frame 4 and has very little ending lag, making it difficult for an opponent to punish her for using it. This allows Rosalina to virtually shut down projectile-reliant playstyles of zoning-oriented characters such as Villager, as their over-reliance on projectiles causes them to have a difficult time fighting her so long as Gravitational Pull is properly used. Although situational, Gravitational Pull can also gimp certain recoveries, with the best examples being PK Thunder; Rosalina can immediately pull away the PSI lightning bolt projectile before Ness or Lucas can use it to recover, rendering them helpless as a result. Aside from Gravitational Pull, Luma can also be used to block projectiles, although this comes at the cost of depleting its HP. Launch Star provides one of the longest and fastest-traveling recovery moves in the game, which when coupled with Rosalina’s extremely slow falling speed and high acceleration makes her less reliant on her double jump offstage, allowing her to travel far out from the sides of the stage while almost always being able to make it back with proper aim and timing.","Despite her various strengths, Rosalina has noticeable weaknesses. Her tall height sometimes makes it very hard to avoid attacks, while her light weight causes her to be very susceptible to early KOs. Although Launch Star provides an extremely long-distanced recovery, it lacks any sort of hitbox (until Luma is able to act at the end of the move), making her vulnerable to meteor smashes; to add insult to injury, the move can be difficult to aim directly upward which can cause players to SD if they find themselves in a scramble situation directly beneath the ledge. Her disadvantage state is extremely poor, as she cannot deal with juggling very well thanks to her slow falling speed and average air speed, though her very high air acceleration, invisible neutral air dodge and hard-to-contest aerials can allow her some control over mixing up her landing.

Her biggest flaw, however, is that she is drastically weakened without Luma, as her respective attacks' knockback values are unimpressive and both Luma Shot and Star Bits are rendered useless. Although Luma will inevitably respawn, the 10 seconds it takes to do so can be more than enough time for the opponent to land a combo or score a KO on Rosalina. This is further compounded by Luma's inability to act out of a tumble until landing on the ground, as attacks that knock Luma off-stage will result in it being inevitably KO'd, regardless of how much HP it has. Most of the cast also has a reliable move to use in order to KO Luma and thus avoid the risk of being punished by Rosalina. Luma's vulnerability is coupled with Luma possessing no way to shield on it's own, with the only way to protect it being through Rosalina's shield. Luma's lack of any shield can potentially put it at risk whenever it is tethered away from Rosalina, making it so that some characters with strong projectiles can easily KO a de-tethered Luma. Luma's lack of rolls, a spotdodge, or an airdodge makes it very easy for opponents to pressure it if Rosalina is forced to dodge an attack. Luma's lack of a grab also makes it have difficulty pressuring shields without being tethered to Rosalina. Additionally, both Rosalina and Luma have a particularly difficult time against characters with larger disjoints or fast moves that deal high base knockback, especially because Luma takes more knockback than it did in SSB4. Characters with swords or other long, disjointed hitboxes will have no problem using their weapons to easily outrange both her and Luma, challenge her attempts at aerial pressure, and juggle her, making it difficult for her to wall them out and putting Rosalina in a position where a mistake could easily result in her taking a large amount of damage or even losing a stock.","Overall, Rosalina & Luma have a high learning curve, where players must become comfortable with using her aerial bait-and-punish abilities as well as her grounded keep away options. Players must also learn when to separate Rosalina from Luma, as well as when to protect each during the course of a match with their various options. Mastering her unique playstyle allows for creating impressive tag-team combos and scoring KOs through strong pressure."
Hero,7,6.348,"Hero is ranked 44th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B- tier. Hero is one of the most unusual characters in the game, boasting the single most amount of moves for a single character, thanks to his down special in Command Selection and variants of the rest of his special moves. Hero has amazing strengths in having a lot of disjointed range in his aerials, such as forward air, neutral air, and back air. He also has good ground speed and drift to aid his mobility. In addition, his smash attacks are notorious as they have a 1 in 8 chance to critical hit, with devastating KO power and damage. Hero's special moves are arguably his biggest asset. His side special, Zap, most notably its 2nd form in Zapple, is a solid long-range poking tool to attack opponents at bay. His down special Command Selection gives him an extensive and dynamic amount of options, with some spells ranging from buffing his normals or speed (Oomph, Psyche Up, Acceleratle), an active reflector (Bounce), the easiest recovery back to the stage (Zoom), powerful KO tools (Hatchet Man, Flame Slash, Kaboom, etc), or instant KO moves that have a chance to KO extremely early (Whack and Thwack). All in all, this makes Hero one of the scariest characters to fight if he has the right options for the right situations.

Despite these strengths, Hero has several weaknesses. His spells rely on his MP Gauge, which can only be reliably replenished by hitting opponents with non-special moves: if he is very low on MP, he has a lot of trouble in neutral since he is unable to use most of his beneficial spells. Hero also has below average frame data overall, making most of his attacks easy to parry or hold shield against. His disadvantage state is pretty mediocre as his recovery is easy to intercept since it lacks a hitbox in the ascent, and he also has trouble landing or getting back on the ground due to his limited options. Finally, the sheer unpredictability of Command Selection means that Hero cannot reliably roll for his strongest spells, with some being devastating to use by accident (eg. Kamikazee, Kaclang).

Overall, Hero remains to be one of the most unpredictable characters in the game and a contentious character to debate on, with a lot of X factor and upset potential due to how much he relies on RNG. While his normals offset his specials, Hero is a force to be reckoned with in the right hands. Hero's representation in competitive play is fairly limited and rare but he has seen success from players, such as Akakikusu and BeastModePaul, taking him far in tournaments with the right luck and bracket.","Hero is a tall, middleweight swordsman. As a result, he has long range and his overall damage output is fittingly above-average, but he is prone to being hit easily and is very susceptible to combos. Hero has respectable overall mobility: he has a slow walking speed, slightly below-average air speed and poor air acceleration, but his dashing speed, initial dash, traction, falling speed, and fast falling speed are all either average or above-average.","Hero has a good defensive game. Similar to the three Links, Hero actually sports two shields: the standard shield action that every fighter has, and another equipped on his left arm most of the time. Hero's shield can block projectiles while he is standing idle, walking, or crouching. The wearable shield also affects the first hit of Hero's forward tilt by granting invincibility to his left arm, head and left leg because of this shield's position, similarly to Palutena's dash attack and back aerial.

Hero possesses a unique fighter ability called the MP Gauge, which has a maximum of 100 Magic Points (MP) and will deplete whenever he uses a special move. MP is restored whenever he hits opponents with attacks, and also restores gradually over time. Although his special moves completely rely on the MP Gauge, they possess tremendous utility. His neutral special, Frizz, is a fireball that travels fast, far and deals decent damage, allowing Hero to disrupt enemy approaches. In addition, unlike other Frizz spells, Frizz has low vertical knockback, making it possible to start juggles or even true combos. Frizz can be charged into Frizzle, which can beat other projectiles and KO near the ledge at reasonable percentages, or Kafrizz for even more damage, knockback and traveling distance, turning it into a viable KO move even at mid percentages.

Hero's side special, Zap, has good range for its start-up, deals respectable damage and KOs at very high percentages. Zap can be charged into Zapple, which grants even more range and damage while being a vertical KO move at high percentages, or Kazap, which results in a attack that sacrifices speed and range for power, being able to KO most opponents center stage at a mere 50%. Additionally, Kazap has damage-based armor that withstands up to 15%, allowing it to resist oncoming attacks. Zap and its variants are disjointed melee attacks, giving them excellent range and, contrary to their appearances, all the lightning bolts generated on hit are immune to reflection and absorption.

Hero's up special, Woosh, is a quick recovery move and is also Hero's fastest and most reliable out of shield punish. Woosh can be charged into Swoosh, granting more vertical distance and horizontal mobility, or Kaswoosh, which provides tremendous vertical distance. Additionally, all Woosh spells leave behind tornadoes, which serve as lingering hitboxes that can damage opponents and gimp opposing recoveries or setup into devastating setups from below the ledge. Finally, his down special, Command Selection, gives Hero a list of four random spells which offer a wide variety of effects. Most of these spells have significant advantages and little disadvantages, which can be seen here. The Command Selection can be canceled by inputting the shield button or by jumping, allowing Hero to repeatedly switch the menu of spells until he has an ideal set of them.

Hero's smash attacks all share a unique perk: they have a 1/8 chance of striking with a critical hit, doubling their damage output and significantly increasing their knockback, allowing them to KO at extremely early percentages. In addition, they cause the smash attacks to cause more shieldstun, making them slightly safer on shield. Even without this perk, Hero's smash attacks have some utility: his forward smash is his strongest smash attack in both damage and knockback, having large range to boot, making it terrific for hard reads or punishes, his up smash has high vertical range, being a reliable anti-air option, good for halting aerial opponents' approaches while remaining a good KOing tool (though it suffers from nonexistent horizontal range, being unable to hit grounded opponents), and his down smash is his weakest smash attack, though it is also his fastest and can be used to punish rolls or spot dodges. Thus, it is a reliable edge-guarding attack in its own right.

Hero's other grounded attacks still possess utility, even if they are less overwhelming than his smash attacks and special moves. Neutral attack has a respectable start-up, damage output and good range, making it good for both damage-racking at low percentages, spacing and for warding off immediate pressure. As stated earlier, forward tilt's first hit has blocking capabilities, making it a defensive option that can beat other moves or projectiles and then be followed up with a second hit—a sword slash—which offers better range, identical speed, and more power, allowing for setting up edge-guards or outright KOs near the edge.

Up tilt has wide range, a respectable damage output and decent start-up lag; these traits make it a fantastic anti-air option, a serviceable KO option at high percentages, and a much more consistent alternative to up smash. Down tilt has good range—superseding Hero's neutral attack—while offering the same speed and launching vertically; it can be used to hit opponents hanging on the edge and start set-ups. Dash attack boasts high power for an attack of its type at the cost of its high overall lag, being able to KO at 80% from the edge. Lastly, Hero's up and down throws sport some utility. Up throw is his strongest throw and has situational utility as both a combo starter and KO option, being able to KO before 200%, unlike his other throws. Conversely, down throw is a good combo starter at low to medium percentages, and can lead into dangerous set-ups.

Hero's aerial moveset, while not as good as that of many other swordfighters, is impressive nonetheless. Neutral aerial has wide range around him and launches at a diagonal angle, being a situational combo starter and useful shield poking option. Forward and especially back aerials are both slow (with back aerial being among the slowest of its kind), but they are respectably strong and KO middleweights beginning around 100% and 85%, respectively. Up aerial has the lowest lag out of any of Hero's aerials and deals very low damage and knockback, enabling it to effectively initiate combos into itself or other moves, or even set up KO confirms at varying percentages. Lastly, down aerial is Hero's most damaging aerial, but also one of his slowest. Its clean hit is capable of meteor smashing opponents, leading to KOs as low as 20% on offstage foes.","But for all the strengths that Hero has, they do come with a price. His access to his special moves is restricted by their reliance on MP. Without enough MP, he is unable to cast any spells, which may put him in great danger offstage as Woosh will only give him a very small boost without MP. While his Command Selection is very versatile, its random nature means that a desired spell is unlikely to be available. Command Selection also renders Hero unable to move when the menu is open, with his only options being to jump or shield, both of which cancel the move and creates a new set of spells when he uses the move again.

While this often is not an issue due to most of the spells having quick startup and good range, as well as the Hero player being able to select the spell quickly, this can sometimes pose a problem if the opponent is in a prime position to punish Hero, which can force the player to sacrifice an ideal set of spells by canceling the move or potentially cause them to panic and use the wrong spell altogether. On top of this, some of his spells have very little utility (such as Metal Slash, which deals 1% and extremely low set knockback against non-metal opponents), while one of them, Hocus Pocus, grants any one of a slew of effects, albeit with detrimental ones outnumbering and outweighing the possible benefits.

Many of Hero's attacks suffer from slow start-up lag (dash attack), high ending lag (up tilt, down tilt, and the second hit of forward tilt), or both (forward and back aerials). Due to being a tall middleweight with slightly above-average falling speed and a lack of any fast or invincible attacks, Hero is also very susceptible to combos. This weakness may be exacerbated further through Hocus Pocus' giant effect, and Oomph applying a 1.2× damage multiplier to attacks that hit him.

Hero's below-average frame data, high raw damage output and attacks' high knockback values also collectively give him a limited combo game; only certain attacks (particularly neutral aerial, up aerial, up throw, and down throw) can successfully generate true combos. Even then, the fast start-up of Hero's grabs is offset by their very short ranges, while up and down throws' combo potentials wane noticeably past low and medium percentages, respectively. Up aerial suffers from poor range and down tilt suffers from aforementioned high ending lag, preventing it from performing any true combos.","Overall, Hero has many strengths and many weaknesses. While he does have a plethora of magic spells at his disposal, a high overall damage output, and a healthy number of strong KO options, he suffers from sluggish frame data, a susceptibility to combos, a reliance on random chance, a limited combo game, and finite resources that are slow to recharge. While there is some potential and strategy in Hero's normal moveset, victory or defeat will frequently come down to resource management and luck. While players such as Salem and Akakikusu have shown Hero's potential at tournaments, his representation has been below-average overall. As such, his viability remains up for debate."
Ken,7,6.319,"Ken is ranked 45th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B- tier. Ken is known as the more aggressive shoto, being able to dish out huge amounts of damage from his multitude of combos and strings, finishing off his opponents with strong KO confirms into his Shoryuken. Like his fellow Street Fighter friend, Ken has a lot of good frame data on his moves and the distinction of having the auto-turnaround mechanic which allows him to perform his combos easier and more reliably. His Shoryuken in particular is great as an anti-air with high knockback growth when the last hit connects or when all hits on the ground connect with each other.

However, Ken shares nearly the same amount of weaknesses as Ryu, being fairly easy to combo reliably and easily edgeguarded if one reads his linear recovery route. In addition, unlike Ryu, Ken is vulnerable to some of his moves being able to be escaped via SDI, such as his Shoryuken and Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, allowing his opponent to punish him for landing those moves. Finally, Ken is forced to approach in a lot of matchups with his limited amount of approach options, making him linear overall.

Overall, Ken is seen as a capable and viable fighter in the right hands with his strong advantage state and combo ability, and players can choose to play either Ken or Ryu, depending on the matchup or mood. For example, if the matchup requires an aggressive game plan, then Ken is the optimal choice. As such, many players who play Ken also play Ryu, although there are several successful players dedicated to just Ken, such as Jahzz0 and takera.","As the more aggressive ""shoto"" compared to Ryu, Ken shares most of his attributes with some slight tweaks. As a heavyweight with average mobility, Ken has decent frame data and damage output, as well as a dependable ground game due to his decent traction and above-average dashing speed. However, other attributes are polarized in an attempt to replicate the physics of Street Fighter; Ken's walking speed is extremely slow, and while his air speed is above average, this is counteracted by his moderately high falling speed and short jumps. Additionally, he has very low air acceleration, and his air friction is uniquely locked at 0 while jumping, causing his jumps to follow a fixed ""arc"" unless the player steers them manually. Finally, Ken's fast fall increases his falling speed by 40% instead of the usual 60%. Overall, this grants Ken effective burst movement through dashing and jumping, but forces him to commit when approaching through the air and makes it difficult to land or move short distances.","Despite his average attributes, Ken is one of the most unique fighters in Ultimate, as he has access to many variations of both his standard and special attacks (a trait only shared with his base fighter, Ryu). His jab and tilts can either be held or tapped; tapped attacks are faster and usually combo well into themselves, while held attacks have greater KO potential and can serve as combo finishers. This also applies to his special moves (other than Focus Attack), which gain different effects like increased power or altered hitboxes when the button is held; they also see an increase in power when used with the original Street Fighter inputs. This effectively gives Ken two movesets—one for starting combos and racking up damage, and the other for scoring KOs. This versatility gives him access to potent true combos and mix-ups, leading to a strong punish game overall.

Ken's standard attacks are also unique in that most of them (even his tapped tilts) have an increased hitlag multiplier, often of at least 1.5x, mimicking the impact of hits connecting in traditional fighter games. Consequently, this results in several of his attacks being easier to SDI, especially up tilt due to it also having an increased SDI multiplier, but it also grants the player more time to perform command inputs when Kara Canceling attacks on hit.

Ken's grounded moveset boasts considerable utility. His tapped jab and down tilt both hit on frame 3, making the former useful for relieving pressure, and the latter excellent for extending combos due to its launch trajectory being useful for followups, such as grabs. Tapped up tilt's low knockback, high speed and active frames make it effective for combos, either into itself, Shoryuken, or even down aerial at high percents near the ledge. Held down tilt can be canceled on hit into a special move, making it effective for shield pressure and damage-racking even at high percents. Down smash is very fast and can cancel into his special moves, and up smash lowers Ken's hurtbox while charging and is quite powerful for its speed. Both tapped forward tilt and held jab are altered at close range, both becoming very potent at starting combos into his special moves. Tapped distant forward tilt is an extremely useful combo starter, leading into a number of options, most notably down aerial and neutral air. Additionally, Ken will automatically face his opponent when there is only one foe left (while standing on the ground), making it considerably easier to land his effective ground attacks.

Ken's aerial moveset is effective as well. Neutral aerial is a sex kick with low knockback and has only five frames of landing lag, making it useful for combos and kill confirms even at high percents. Forward aerial is quick, highly damaging and has good range; it can be chained into itself through repeated jumps, and its sourspot deals high shield damage. Up aerial has fast startup, a fairly active hitbox and decently high reach, making it useful for juggling. It is also reliably follows up into Shoryuken. Both up and down aerial are also able to auto-cancel from a short hop.

Complementing Ken's moveset and combo potential is his wide array of powerful finishers; some of his held tilts, smash attacks and aerials are very capable KO moves due to their high speed. Held up tilt grants upper body intangibility on frames 4-10 while hitting on frame 7, making it deceptively safe for KOs when combined with its speed and tapped up tilt setups. Up smash makes an effective substitute for held up tilt as a finisher, and its wide hitbox can catch aerial approaches. Ken's forward smash has long range, fast startup and is his strongest standard ground attack, making it useful for hard punishes. Back aerial is Ken's strongest aerial, and is fast and has good range despite its small hitbox. Forward aerial also serves as a decent KO move, enhancing its already impressive utility. Finally, down aerial is a powerful meteor smash with fast start-up and long duration, making it a deadly edgeguarding tool. Combined with his excellent combo ability, Ken's punish game is incredibly effective and versatile, being able to rack up damage or KO very easily after connecting with almost any attack.

Ken's signature special moves are also effective in their own ways. Hadoken is a large ki projectile, with three travel speeds based on input method; the standard version is capable of locking, while the input variation deals more damage. Tatsumaki Senpukyaku propels Ken forward, hitting multiple times throughout the attack, and potentially leading to followups, but the non-input version is unsafe on hit. While Ken's signature Shoryuken serves as his main vertical recovery move, it is most well-known for its offensive utility, due to its sweetspot's high knockback, multiple powerful hitboxes, and brief intangibility (frame 5), making it both a powerful KO option and a potent anti-air. The input version of Shoryuken has increased KO power, even longer intangibility (frames 4-6, with arm intangibility frames 1-14), and lower landing lag, and can easily be chained into from Ken's other moves. Focus Attack grants Ken heavy armor against a single hit, and incapacitates opponents when at least half charged, allowing for followups. It can also be canceled on hit, after tanking a blow, or even while charging, allowing Ken to fake out with a shuffle that also provides horizontal recovery distance. His close held neutral attack, first two hits of tapped neutral attack, close tapped forward tilt, distant taped forward tilt, down smash, held down tilt, and all aerials can be canceled into special moves, allowing Ken to combo into Shoryuken for KOs, Tatsumaki Senpukyaku for extending combos, and Focus Attack for mixups and safety.

Outside of the standard special moves, Ken also has access to the Oosoto Mawashi Geri roundhouse kick and the Nata Otoshi Geri crescent kick using inputs only. The former is a powerful KO option at the edge with much more safety than his other special moves, while the latter is a combo extender that leads into either a forward smash, a down smash, or even a Shoryuken with proper reading. Furthermore, both attacks can be cancelled into Inazuma Kick, which deals heavy shield damage, further complementing his ability to pressure and deplete shields with his lengthy blockstrings.

Lastly, Ken has a long-distanced recovery and is surprisingly difficult to combo, traits not shared with most heavyweights. Tatsumaki Senpukyaku has large hitboxes and doesn't cause helplessness; this combined with canceled Focus Attack's armor and momentum boost grants surprisingly effective horizontal distance and protection. Shoryuken travels a good vertical distance, reaches above edges, and can stage spike reckless edgeguarders. Focus Attack also serves as an effective combo breaker, and neutral aerial and input Shoryuken both grant high speed and intangibility, and can even lead into combo or KO opportunities respectively. These traits allow Ken to survive to very high percents when used effectively, which also allows him to take full advantage of rage.","Despite his abundant strengths, Ken has his weaknesses as well, most of them shared with Ryu. Though his recovery travels a long distance, it becomes very short if extendable elements, such as Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, cannot be utilized. Focus Attack requires a brief charge before it can be canceled. Tatsumaki Senpukyaku's long duration and low damage makes it vulnerable to being interrupted by long-ranged attacks, and he can only use it once without landing or being dealt hitstun. Ken's falling speed, low jumps and poor air acceleration make it difficult to recover from below the stage, as Shoryuken's recovery is almost strictly vertical and has high endlag, making Ken's vertical recovery easy to predict and interrupt. While Ken excels at shield pressure, his grab game is sorely lacking; his throws have high damage, but none of them have effective follow-up or KO potential. Down throw is his only combo throw at very low percents, and the extra utility of his throws (down throw instantly breaking shields, and up throw's kick KOing bystanders) does not apply in a 1-on-1 setting, making them situational.

Although Ken has an overall good neutral game, it does suffer from noticeable flaws. Despite his good frame data (especially for his tapped tilts and neutral aerial) and decent running speed, his slow walking speed and short range hinders the otherwise great utility of his tilt attacks, which gives him trouble against characters who possess disjointed hitboxes, especially when combined with his tall stature. Ken's only projectile, Hadoken, is punishable if used carelessly due to its long endlag, weak damage and low priority. Aside from the advantages granted his neutral aerial and Focus Attack, Ken's fixed arc jumps make his aerial approach highly committal and thus very predictable. These issues force Ken to play patiently and take advantage of any opening, as he has trouble against opposing camping. Focus Attack's utility is also match-up dependent, as it becomes much less effective against fast or multi-hitting moves (such as Roy's forward aerial or Cloud's Cross Slash, respectively). Because Focus Attack is also Ken's main method of escaping combos, this makes him susceptible to certain combos and juggles due to his high weight and quick falling speed, and his slower fast-fall compared to most other characters occasionally makes it difficult to land safely.

Finally, Ken struggles to ""force"" early KOs, as his KO potential relies heavily on executing combos. While Ken does possess some powerful moves, like back aerial and sweetspotted forward smash, these usually require hard reads to land, and most of his other moves have low knockback scaling due to being tailored for combos. Ken's superb combo ability does largely compensate for this, but without accounting for opposing smash directional influence, or without full knowledge of Ken's moveset, setups and combos, he can have a difficult time taking stocks. Ken's multihit special moves can be fallen out of if not used properly, leading to him being unsafe, or even punishable if he is not careful. Finally, the emphasis on Ken's unique inputs means that his non-input special moves have lower power, and a mere slip of the hand can be more detrimental than usual, at worst even causing a self-destruct while recovering.","Overall, Ken is a combo-oriented fighter with a fearsome offensive potential, as his unique mechanics deliberately give him access to powerful true combos essential to the competitive success of most characters; his ability to trap opponents in hitstun or shield pressure, multiple options for escaping or negating combos, and dependable recovery all make Ken very rewarding and unpredictable. However, his polarized movement, mediocre vertical recovery, and lacking approach make him difficult to play optimally. His high learning curve in particular is perhaps his biggest issue; much practice is generally required for his input specials to use them reliably and consistently, rather than accidentally inputting the wrong move."
Toon Link,7,6.249,"Toon Link is ranked 46th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B- tier. This is a noticeable drop from his 23rd out of 54 placement in SSB4 and is his worst placement in the series. Toon Link's gameplan is relatively a middle ground between Young Link's strong projectile and combo game and Link's strong kill power or Bomb usage. Toon Link has a pretty strong zoning game thanks to his numerous projectiles in Bomb and Boomerang. The former allows him to set up combos or confirm into KOs at higher percents while the latter is a good combo starter or a way for opponents to approach him in neutral. Toon Link's mobility is also among the best of the three Links on the ground, allowing him to catch up or run away from his opponents more reliably. His frame 2 air dodge and floatiness also allow him to escape from more combos too.

Toon Link has some weaknesses similarly shared to the other Links. Because of his floatiness, it makes him take a while to land back on the ground, making him prone to juggling. Toon Link also has lower range than most other swordfighters who can outrange and pressure better than he can. His recovery is also relatively exploitable as it travels in a predictable path, though it can be mixed up with Bomb Jump.

Overall, Toon Link is a character with a simple, effective, and consistent gameplan that works when he gets momentum or wins neutral interactions. Toon Link has seen some strong results and representation mostly in Japan, through players, such as Lv.1 and Sigma, who have had strong placements at majors.","Toon Link is a middleweight, yet boasts above-average dashing speed and air acceleration, as well as the ability to wall jump. However, his air speed is average and his falling and fast falling speeds are both slow, while his gravity is low. Although they differ on the majority of their attributes, Toon Link and Link both have above-average walking speeds. Like Link, he also wields his respective version of the Master Sword and possesses a shield. The Master Sword grants Toon Link disjointed range, while the Hero's Shield blocks opposing projectiles if he is standing still or walking. Overall, Toon Link's attributes render him as a fairly quick, yet fairly floaty character.","As a zoning-orientated character, Toon Link possesses a number of projectiles. His Hero's Bow, Boomerang and Bomb enable him to not only force approaches, but also camp effectively. His Hero's Bow and Boomerang in particular are very strong in the neutral game, both being b-reversable and relatively quick. The Hero's Bow is extremely quick and lasts for a long time, at the expense of being slightly slower, but also traveling further, even when uncharged. The Boomerang is slightly less quick than the bow, but can be angled and has very minimal endlag. His Bomb is also very good in the neutral, due to its status as an item and its large explosion hitbox. Because it is an item, it can be thrown in many directions like his boomerang.

In addition to these strengths, Boomerang and Bomb boast combo potential, with the latter being his most varied and useful combo starter. Thanks to its explosion no longer damaging Toon Link upon contact with an opponent, Bomb now grants him a number of follow-ups at varying percentages. With precise usage, it can be followed by his up smash or forward aerial even at high percentages, both of which are among his most viable KOing options, or down aerial for extremely early KOs. Bomb's combo potential is further supplemented by jump-canceling and its status as an item, with the latter trait ensuring that its combo potential is never susceptible to rage or stale-move negation. Although it is not as versatile in comparison, Boomerang is nevertheless useful for Toon Link's combo game, as it can combo into his up tilt, grab and various other moves depending on its positioning.

Although Toon Link's combo game largely revolves around Bomb, he also possesses non-projectile combo starters. Up tilt is the most effective of these: it can combo into itself, up smash, and Spin Attack at low percentages; a short hopped neutral aerial, short hopped back aerial, and short hopped Spin Attack at low to medium percentages; and forward aerial and up aerial at medium to high percentages, which are reliable for kills. Aside from up tilt, grab aerial can be used as a long-ranged set-up similarly to Bomb, regardless of the opponent's damage, while neutral attack can be jab canceled reliably.","However, Toon Link has some weaknesses. His grab game is overall very polarized: Hookshot grants him long-lasting grabs that can grab airborne opponents, and a grab aerial and tether recovery that are both very useful, yet his grabs have considerable start-up and ending lag (albeit much less so than in previous installments). By extension, Toon Link's back throw is one of his most viable KO options due to being one of the strongest back throws in the game, while his forward throw is decent for setting up edge-guards and creating space. Conversely, Toon Link's down throw lacks combo potential, which makes it drastically inferior to Link and Young Link's versions. It can almost combo into back aerial. Although Toon Link's up throw is a situational KO option on platforms like Link and Young Link's versions, his back throw utterly outclasses it in this role. As a result, Toon Link's up and down throws are used primarily for setting up aerial pressure, such as by launching an opponent into the trajectory of a previously thrown Boomerang or Bomb.

Toon Link's floatiness makes him particularly susceptible to strong vertical attacks, and renders his recovery quite predictable in spite of its improvements. Unlike other floaty characters, however, Toon Link cannot use his floatiness to perform long aerial combos because of his aerials' considerable ending lag. Toon Link's disjointed range is also somewhat offset by his short size, while the faster pace of Ultimate makes his defensive, projectile-based gameplan less effective than it was in previous installments.","Overall, Toon Link is considered a very balanced and fast fighter with a plethora of attack options via his projectiles, tether grab/recovery, and decent frame data. The combination of low ending lag on his forward and back aerials with his slow fall speed allow Toon Link to dominate in the air with combos, while his moderately fast yet fairly useful tilt attacks and reasonably strong smash attacks allow for relatively easy KOs. While his middling weight and slow falling speed make him easier to combo and KO, it is generally agreed that Toon Link's strengths outweigh his weaknesses by a fair margin."
Ness,7,6.174,"Ness is currently ranked 47th out of 82 characters on the Ultimate tier list, placing him in the B- tier. While this could be seen as a slight drop from Smash 4, when he was ranked 28th/29th out of 54 characters (tied with Lucas), his incarnation in Ultimate is generally considered his strongest in the series. Ness has a fairly well-rounded design in Ultimate, with useful tools in most phases of the game. He is most notable for his fantastic air game: all of his aerials can autocancel in a short hop, have low landing lag and are fast, powerful, disjointed, and useful for both racking up damage and KOing. His grab game is also among the best in the cast, as all of his throws have practical uses: His down throw is a viable combo starter, his forward and up throw force opponents in unfavourable situations where they can be juggled or edgeguarded and his back throw is among the strongest KO throws in the game. Furthermore, Ness' specials all have flexible utility: PK Flash, PSI Magnet, and PK Fire can all start or extend combos, while the latter can quickly rack up damage and set up strong punishes. Ness's recovery has improved in Ultimate thanks to buffs to PK Thunder and PK Thunder 2 — and by virtue of having the longest directional air dodge distance in the game alongside Lucas.

However, Ness does have some exploitable weaknesses. He suffers from poor grounded mobility and a lack of range in his normal attacks. Altogether, characters with large and/or disjointed hitboxes can easily outrange Ness, forcing him to play defensively and leaving him with few options in neutral and disadvantage. Because of his slow mobility on the ground, his approach options are also limited, especially when combined with his aforementioned sub-par range. Still, his most glaring flaw is perhaps his recovery, which, despite its improvements, is exploitable by many characters.

As a result of his strengths and weaknesses, Ness is viewed as a strong but volatile character in competitive play. Players such as Gackt, Scend, and Syrup have seen consistent success with Ness in tournaments.","Ness is a versatile character with strong tools for a variety of situations. Although he has relatively poor ground movement — his walking speed, initial dash, and dash speed are below average, as well as his air speed — his aerial movement shines thanks to his excellent air acceleration, above-average jump height, and unique double jump cancelling ability. Further bolstering his aerial game, Ness' low gravity and low falling speed allow him to perform multiple aerials in one short hop, and all of his aerial normals can be auto-canceled. Ness has three projectiles with numerous applications, including juggling, edgeguarding, and even recovery. Despite his small stature, Ness is a middleweight, tied with Lucas, Mii Brawler, and Inkling.","Ness' outstanding aerial movement is supported by one of the best sets of aerial normals in the entire game. His neutral aerial activates on frame 5 and functions well as a combo-breaker and out-of-shield option. It also sets up tech chase situations at middle percents and has decent knockback at high percents, making it a viable edgeguarding and KO option. His forward aerial has a large disjoint and is quite active, making it excellent for starting combos, edgeguarding, and approaching. Ness' new multi-hit up aerial is strong and great for juggling, and its drag-down properties allow Ness to set up grabs, combos, and KOs. Ness' back aerial is fast and very strong when sweetspotted, and his down aerial is a slow-but-powerful meteor smash useful for edgeguarding or starting vertical combos.

Ness' grab and throw game is also outstanding and among the best in the cast. His grab is relatively fast, and all of his throws have useful applications. Ness' down throw is a solid combo starter that will often lead into multiple forward airs, and his forward throw has very high base knockback, allowing Ness to reliably set up edgeguarding situations. Ness' up throw, while not as practical, is a solid mix-up that can set up juggling with PK Thunder or PK Flash. Most notorious, however, is Ness' back throw, which remains the most consistent kill throw in the game.

Ness' ground game, while limited by his poor ground mobility, features some powerful attacks. His forward tilt and dash attack are fast and strong enough to KO at high percents, and the latter has improved range. His up tilt is a good combo tool at low percents and can even KO at higher percents. His down tilt, which is very fast and highly spammable, can be used to two-frame, jab lock, pressure shields, confirm into a grab, or deal immense damage if the opponent is trapped at the ledge. His forward smash (baseball bat) has high start-up and ending lag, but deals very high damage and knockback, especially when sweetspotted with the tip of the bat. The bat is also a reflector with a damage multiplier of 2.0 and a speed multiplier of 2.5, giving it the second highest damage multiplier (after Kazuya's Left Splits Kick) and the single highest speed multiplier of any reflector in the game, excluding items. Ness' up and down smashes (yo-yo) have significantly improved knockback, deal damage while charging, and can hang below the stage, making them some of the best and easiest-to-use edgeguarding tools in the game.

Ness is perhaps best known for his special moves. His neutral special, PK Flash, is a large projectile that travels in an arc from Ness' head, gaining strength and distance depending on how long the input is held for. Because it has low ending lag and freezes opponents briefly when successful, PK Flash has great utility as a combo starter and juggling tool. It also no longer sends Ness into helplessness, making it useful for knocking opponents away from the ledge while Ness is offstage. Ness' side special, PK Fire, is a tiny projectile that travels horizontally a short distance and bursts into a pillar of flames on contact with an opponent, dealing multiple hits. When used in the air, PK Fire has a diagonal trajectory and decreased landing lag, bolstering its safety in neutral, especially on platforms. The move is infamously spammable and can set up combos, condition opponents to jump, or simply rack up damage itself. Ness' up special, PK Thunder, doubles as a versatile projectile and Ness' primary recovery option. The move sends a ball of electricity upward from Ness' head that can be guided with the control stick, costing Ness his mobility while active, but granting him the ability to pressure deep offstage, juggle opponents repeatedly, or at times KO an opponent into the upper blast zone. Ness can also send the lightning into himself at any angle, launching him in that direction for an extremely powerful PK Thunder 2 attack which also allows Ness to recover from deep offstage. Ness' down special, PSI Magnet, creates a psychic field around Ness that absorbs energy-based attacks and heals Ness a proportionate percent. PSI Magnet also has newfound offensive utility in Ultimate, as it now features an active hitbox with set knockback. The aerial hitbox can confirm into several of Ness' normal aerials, while the grounded hitbox places opponents in perfect range for a sweetspotted forward smash, making it practical in jab lock situations. PSI Magnet also alters the momentum of Ness' double jump, a form of double jump cancelling that makes for a unique aerial burst option and a stylish way to start or extend combos.","Ness' strengths are balanced by notable weaknesses. Grounded PK Fire does good damage, but is punishable on shield and easily escapable with good DI, making it generally less useful than its aerial counterpart. While Ness' hitboxes are large and powerful, he can still be stuffed out by characters with even larger disjoints. Moreover, Ness' below-average run speed and average air speed, as well as his projectiles being rather slow or short-ranged, render him slightly vulnerable to camping, especially against opponents with non-energy projectiles. Ness is also vulnerable to juggling given his floatiness and lack of reliable landing options, as well as the removal of multiple air dodges. However, Ness' most glaring weakness remains his recovery. Despite traveling a good distance, his PK Thunder 2 is quite exploitable: if the attack makes contact with an opponent or projectile mid-flight, its distance will be halved, often resulting in a gimp. Furthermore, opponents with good timing can hit Ness with a powerful attack or fall into PK Thunder 1 before he can launch himself. Because of its enormous knockback, PK Thunder 2 is also susceptible to many counters, and opponents who time their counter correctly will almost always kill Ness. Conversely, opponents who mistime an edgeguard against Ness will often die for it.","Overall, Ness is somewhat of a ""glass cannon"" character who excels in most offensive aspects of the game, but suffers in certain defensive situations, especially when put offstage or high above his opponent. He also struggles against characters who can outrange his disjoints, though this is less of a problem than in previous games."
Mega Man,7,6.163,"Mega Man is ranked 48th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the B- tier. This is a moderate drop from his previous placement in SSB4, being ranked 27th out of 54. Mega Man, akin to his home series, has an outstanding zoning game with a multitude of projectiles at his disposal. His signature iconic move in his Mega Buster projectiles (jab, neutral aerial, and forward tilt) is great at applying pressure and stopping approaches while also helping Mega Man's approach. His normals are also solid as all his aerials serve some purpose with both forward and back aerial as edgeguarding disjointed tools and out-of-shield options, with the former being very versatile and the latter being fast and powerful, up aerial as a juggling tool that can KO off the top blast zone, and down aerial as a unique spiking tool that is a projectile. He also has useful smash attacks, as up smash is a solid out-of-shield option, forward smash is a disjointed projectile, and down smash is a powerful finisher, being one of the strongest in the game. His special moves are also important as they are among some of Mega Man's most important aspects as a character. Metal Blade is a useful and versatile projectile that can travel through opponents and can also be picked up and used as an item, allowing for confirms into moves, such as back air, up tilt, and more. Crash Bomber is good for shield pressure and mindgames, which can force opponents into disadvantageous spots. Rush Coil is a solid recovery tool and Mega Man is not sent into a helpless state after using it, which combined with his above average weight, gives him a solid endurance. Finally, Leaf Shield is an amazing projectile that encases a barrier over Mega Man and can also be thrown at opponents. All in all, Mega Man has amazing strengths that he can use for a strong camping and zoning game.

Despite these numerous strengths, Mega Man has several flaws. Mega Man is one of the easiest characters to combo and juggle due to him being at one of the perfect weights for combos or KO confirms. Mega Man also has difficulty landing despite being a fast faller since he lacks good combo escapes or quick landing hitboxes, with his down aerial having very slow startup lag and few options at close range. Due to Mega Man's overreliance on projectiles, he struggles against characters who have reflectors, such as all the space animals or absorption properties, such as Mr. Game and Watch, who can greatly hinder or shut down his entire game plan. While Mega Man has fast air mobility, his lackluster dashing speed limits his options on the ground, and his strongest attacks suffer from generally high startup or ending lag, such as his down smash, which makes them hard to land and/or leave him exposed for a punish.

In conclusion, Mega Man can apply a lot of pressure with his various projectiles and his strong zoning game, however he often struggles when his defenses is broken through. Early results from Mega Man were strong thanks from Kameme, who placed highly at several majors and supermajors. Although Mega Man's representation suffered after Kameme switched to Sora, dedicated mains Peabnut and Repo have continued to produce solid results for him.","Mega Man is a short, heavyweight character who deviates himself in terms of attributes compared to his fellow heavyweights. He has slightly above-average walking speed, average dashing speed, the 19th fastest air speed (tied with Duck Hunt, Sheik, Cloud, Lucas, and Bowser), is tied with Wario for the 26th highest gravity, low traction, the 11th fastest falling speed (tied with Young Link, Roy, Chrom, Wolf, and Falco), and is tied with Rosalina for the 6th fastest air acceleration. Thus, he is aerodynamic in terms of movement and for his weight has decent mobility. As in his home series, Mega Man's moveset relies heavily on various projectiles, giving his attacks unusual functions and characteristics. This extends beyond his special moves and into his standard moveset. For his neutral attack, he fires shots from his Mega Buster, and for his forward tilt, he fires shots from his Mega Buster while walking. His up tilt, the Mega Upper, or Shoryuken as called by commentators, is a jumping uppercut, and his down tilt is a forward slide.","espite having an unusual set of moves, Mega Man shines in approaching while spacing opponents at midrange and disrupting any approaches, for he has two projectiles that can cause opponents to react predictably: Metal Blade's ability to be thrown in eight directions and trapping opponents in high hitstun makes it a fantastic mindgame and shield-baiting tool, while Crash Bomber can cause panicky opponents to run towards Mega Man or shield the explosion. Both projectiles easily lead to a grab punish as Mega Man owns a great grab combo ability, having a fast grab and many of his attacks connecting reliably after a throw. This allows him to rack up damage easily once he grabs an opponent. He does not have much trouble KOing once his opponents are damaged either, for he has many finishing options ranging from his up tilt to his forward and back aerials to his projectile-based forward smash, which can be used to edgeguard. His other projectiles are terrific, notably his aerials; up aerial can rack up damage very quickly and KO early if an opponent is high up, and his down aerial is one of the safest meteor smashes in the game. To top it all off, Mega Man is a fantastic spacer: his jab is a fast and useful projectile (that can be used while moving and jumping) which interrupts most attacks and weak projectiles at a safe range, and when combined with Metal Blades and Crash Bombs makes Mega Man difficult to approach, while also keeping the opponent away from him. He also has a great grab and throw game, with down throw being a reliable combo starter, up throw being useful for pressuring and juggling, and a back throw with great power, KOing reliably. Due to his amazing pressuring ability and grab game, characters without a projectile or with low reach can have trouble approaching without being severely punished. Even if he does get knocked around, Mega Man is a semi-heavyweight character, weighing only slightly less than Ryu, meaning he is more likely to survive potentially lethal blows that could KO a lighter character, especially with proper DI and his good recovery move, Rush Coil, which does not leave him helpless.","Regardless of his good grab game and punishing options, Mega Man still has some flaws to counter his strengths. Since his projectiles are imperative in initiating combos, he suffers against opponents with reflectors or other methods to render his projectiles ineffective, such as the Villager and Isabelle's Pocket. His low speed and ending lag on his non-projectile moves significantly limit his approach. He lacks options in keeping away foes up close, with no actual melee jab or quick standard attacks to knock them away. Because most of his strongest attacks suffer from either noticeable startup or ending lag, Mega Man works best at mid-range where his attacks can connect safely, though at the cost of giving opponents a good amount of time to react to any of his attacks, somewhat making his finishers predictable.","In essence, Mega Man is a very versatile, medium-ranged projectile fighter who has no trouble spacing opponents, though KO attempts can be risky for him as he suffers slightly at close range due to the lag of his attacks. He has to use his effective spacing and grab punish options to rack up damage at medium range while keeping his distance until the opponent is weak enough to risk using one of his slow yet powerful finishing moves. This causes Mega Man to be patient in his gameplan, with him having to wait for one opening to take out stocks effectively. Despite this, his strengths outshine his weaknesses, and he has good representation and great results overall."
Inkling,7,5.923,"Inkling is currently ranked 49th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing her in the B- tier. Inkling boasts an incredibly potent neutral game due to her high mobility, deceptive hurtbox-shifting dash, and several projectiles that complement an offensive repertoire that is characterized by fast frame data and combo potential. Several of her attacks are fast enough to combo into themselves, and back aerial in particular offers great power and a disjoint that can be used for spacing, combos, and combo confirms. Inkling's most unique trait is the ability to cover the enemy in Ink, applying the enemy with a damage multiplier that makes her combos even more devastating, and she can apply Ink through several attacks that are some of her most potent tools such as her neutral attack. She further sports a powerful recovery that allows her to return from anywhere off-stage, and a highly versatile grab game comprised of disjointed pivot and dash grabs, a forward throw that applies Ink, a back throw that KOs at high percentages, and an up throw that can confirm into both combos, as well as a KO confirm off of her up aerial at certain percentages.

However, Inkling is weighed down by several factors that prove problematic to her. Her well-rounded neutral and advantage are almost entirely offset by the borderline fatal flaw of having no reliable KO options. All of her Smash attacks (as well as the Splat Roller) are difficult to score clean hits with and highly punishable on block or whiff, the sweet spot of her forward aerial is similarly precise, and her back aerial is prone to staling due to its frequent usage. This makes her reliant on edgeguarding, reads and situational moves like up aerial and back throw for a lot of KOs; things she can perform decently with but none of which she particularly excels at compared to other characters. Her up throw KO confirm only partially alleviates this issue, as it has varying percentage windows depending on character and stage, and it is further influenced by rage. Moreover, the KO confirm highlights another issue, which is Inkling's linear game plan. Despite having a strong combo game, it is almost entirely centered on Inkling having to grab the opponent since she lacks in the way of reliable combo starters, making her options fairly predictable. Her out of shield options are also sub-par due to awkward hitbox coverage, meaning she plays weaker when on the defensive.

While Inkling was initially believed to be an early top tier contender for the game thanks to strong performances from players such as Cosmos and Space, the character saw stagnation as her weaknesses grew more apparent in light of other characters flourishing, leading to a dwindling player base. Currently, Inkling is considered a speedy jack-of-all-trades who requires more maintenance to do well with under pressure situations than others of her archetype. Despite this, Inkling is still considered a viable character in competitive play, and retains a modest base thanks to the efforts of players such as Shirayuki and showers.","Inkling is a character that excels greatly in many areas but is typically defined by quick, slippery movement and fast attack speed. As a result, most attributes are overall consistent with combo-heavy middleweights, with a focus on a fast-approach ""footsies"" playstyle: she has fast overall mobility due to her high initial dash (16th highest) and dashing speeds (22nd highest), alongside high air speed (12-16th fastest, tied with Sonic, Mario, Little Mac and Donkey Kong). However, the rest of Inkling's traits are mostly average, with middling air acceleration, fall speed, walking speed, average weight, and low traction. As a result, she can easily traverse large distances very quickly, but can have issues changing directions in midair; additionally, the combination of middling weight and fast fall speed do not give much of an advantage when escaping combos.","Inkling's greatest strength is, fittingly, fast general movement and attack speed. Inkling's dash is notable for shifting their entire hurtbox during movement, which in some cases allows them to low-profile through certain attacks, and its obscure animation - which shares a visual similarity with her spot dodge animation - as well as their strong initial dash gives the character one of the strongest and most deceptive dash-dances in the entire game. While the range on many of their attacks is rather lacking, this is made up for by decently fast frame data (although many of her moves have noticeable lag), which allows Inkling to put their fast mobility to good use and rush opponents down in a flurry of moves. Additionally, Inkling boasts a strong ground and aerial offense, with many moves being capable of stringing together, particularly when coupled with an up throw, which is an effective combo initiator until high percents and can even KO through its setups. As a result, opponents can have a tough time finding openings in her offense, since their high speed and low landing lag allow their to weave around any foe very easily and an extremely potent combo ability easily turns any mistake on their end into a potential combo starter.

The character's damage racking potential is further enhanced by the unique ink mechanic, lifted from their origin series. Select moves - such as Splattershot - will cover opponents in ink, which increases damage dealt to them up to a maximum of 1.5×, though this will wear off over time. When an opponent is fully inked, many combos are capable of effectively dishing out surprising amounts of damage over a short period on careless opponents. Because of these traits, alongside aforementioned ones, Inkling sports what is commonly believed by many to be the best neutral attack in the game. It has respectable startup due to it coming out on frame 3. It sports good range and its rapid jab to finisher can occasionally apply enough ink to reach the ink's full damage multiplier, which sets up the opponent for massive damage strings. As a downside, ink also affects the power of certain moves, such as the aforementioned neutral attack infinite, forward throw, special moves and smash attacks, which lose significant KO power or damage when the ink tank is empty (with some moves being rendered completely unusable). Due to this, Inkling has to recharge the ink tank by going into a ""charging"" stance once the ink tank is completely depleted. As this leaves Inkling wide open to attacks with no escape options till the charge animation ends, managing the ink supply with care is crucial, and it is important to keep a safe distance from the opponent when recharging.

Inkling also has powerful offstage capability due to their attributes. Despite having a relatively linear recovery, Inkling is able to vary it by double jumping out of Splat Roller in combination with the very long-reaching Super Jump, allowing the recovery to be less predictable and allowing their to stay airborne for extended periods. Inkling's Super Jump also has a very generous edge sweetspot range, making it hard for certain characters to 2 frame punish them, and due to its deceptive startup hitbox, it can be used to gimp off-stage opponents or even stage spike them in some cases. Coupled with the sheer speed of the moves, this makes it difficult to challenge Inkling with an offstage edgeguard. Inkling also has one of the best air speeds to supplement this and likewise can edgeguard very proficiently through strong usage of aerials. Among the most notable is their back aerial, which is one of her safest moves not only offstage but also in the neutral game, as it sports a notable disjoint - making it one of Inkling's safest moves on shield if properly spaced - and is able to combo into itself at mid-percents, which can lead to a wall of pain in certain situations. Their forward aerial exchanges the disjoint and overall versatility for strength, having stronger knockback when sweetspotted which can lead to guaranteed off-stage KOs at mid-to-high percents and its sourspot can make for a decent gimping tool on select characters. Inkling's Splat Bombs are a crucial tool both in neutral and when covering the edge; while the bomb can be thrown off-stage to intercept the opponent, the angle and awkward timer of the bomb also makes for a powerful frame trapping tool, particularly on opponents that are recovering on the ledge.","Even with a solid set of strengths, the character is not without several weaknesses. Despite having high damage racking potential, most of Inkling's strongest KO moves are all comparatively unsafe - particularly Splat Roller and several smash attacks - often forcing the character to rely on reads, edgeguarding, and immaculate spacing in order to guarantee a KO at earlier percents. While this issue is partially alleviated by Inkling being one of the few characters in the game to have a KO confirm off of a grab, the percentage windows vary from character to character - with the confirm being borderline impossible on a select few characters - and it is also affected by rage. The ink mechanic also forces Inkling to be resourceful with many of their moves, as without ink, they lose access to several crucial attacks such as Splat Roller and Splat Bomb. Despite Inkling's strong aerial combo game, it is highly centralized around grabs due to their lacking a reliable grounded combo starter. This is further compounded by Inkling's mediocre regular ground attacks; despite sporting disjointed hitboxes on her forward tilt and down tilt, they possess little utility outside of spacing due to neither leading into any follow-ups. Finally, Inkling also suffers from dubious hitbox placements, notably in their up tilt which lacks decent horizontal coverage, as well as their neutral aerial, meaning that, despite their good aerial speed, they possess neither the most reliable landing options at a disadvantage, nor the best out of shield options.","Overall, Inkling is a rounded character with solid mobility stats and solid damage racking capability overall. Their deceptive traits and a strong set of attacks make her a versatile fighter that excels both at defensive and offensive play. However, their lack of easy KO options relative to the upper-tier cast forces the character to maintain strong consistency in her play, as she can occasionally struggle to score KOs and make up stock deficits, particularly against opponents who have a much easier time KOing or stuffing out their movement options. In addition, Inkling's potential in doubles was noted by Masahiro Sakurai himself as being one of the character's strengths, allowing teammates to rack up damage even faster."
Meta Knight,7,5.792,"Meta Knight is ranked 50th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the bottom of the B- tier. This is a significant drop from his 16th out of 54 placement in SSB4 and is his worst placement in the series. Meta Knight's strength centers around his amazing ground and air mobility, granting him a strong neutral game, advantage and disadvantage state. He retains excellent frame data, which combined with his mobility grants him an amazing combo game and edgeguarding ability, including his signature up aerial ladder combos which, while nerfed, still has effective setups. Said combos have also been retooled to give him options for combos that KO vertically (Shuttle Loop) or horizontally (Mach Tornado) depending on the opponent's reaction. He also boasts a long, safe recovery which makes it very unlikely for him to be KO'd while recovering, as he has multiple double jumps and all of his special moves function as recovery moves with large or lingering hitboxes, making Meta Knight one of the hardest characters to edgeguard.

However, Meta Knight's main weakness is his poor endurance. He is a lightweight character, and combined with his fast falling speed makes him susceptible to combos and early KOs. He also possesses a relatively small shield, which leaves him vulnerable to shield stabbing. While he can work his way through projectiles and zoners with his relatively small size, quick ground speed and Mach Tornado, his approach options are fairly predictable, so they often carry the risk of losing neutral. He also has lackluster range and below average damage output for a swordfighter which makes it difficult for him to space his attacks, and requires him more effort to rack up damage. His grab game, while better than most other swordfighters, is still mediocre: his standing grab range is one of the worst in the game, and his up throw is his only consistent KO throw that KOs at reasonable percents without rage, while his other throws do not have consistent combo ability beyond mid percents. He also struggles in KOing opponents due to having finishers that are difficult to land, and most of his attacks have very few active frames (with his most useful attacks having only 1-3 frame hitboxes). This forces Meta Knight to rely on precision to hit opponents and especially to finish them off. Finally, his combos are very susceptible to SDI, forcing him to mix up his combos and kill confirms and keep track of the opponent's reaction, and his best combo tools are very prone to staling due to their low base damage (with some such as up aerial able to drop to as low as 2% per hit even with the 1v1 multiplier).

Meta Knight's drastic decline in the tier list is based more on his below-average representation throughout Ultimate's lifespan rather than the character not being very capable of viability. Despite that, Meta Knight still retains a fairly noticeable playerbase, with players such as Abadango, BONK!, and Metara achieving commendable results with the character.","Meta Knight combines several unusual traits. He has multiple jumps, but unlike other characters who share this ability, he has strong mobility, comprising fast dashing and walking speeds, high falling speed and gravity, and average air speed. He is also the only small character to use a sword, which gives his attacks a bit more range relative to his stature. Overall, unlike other characters with multiple jumps, Meta Knight is neither wanting for speed nor range.","s expected, Meta Knight's playstyle relies heavily on his speed, both in terms of mobility and frame data. His low, quick short hop and fast, low lag aerials allow him to continuously apply pressure to opponents at close range. He is not lacking in grounded pressure either, having a fast down tilt that can trip, and a dash attack that can cross-up shields, and both of these moves are capable of setting up combos. If Meta Knight finds himself on the defensive, he has several options to relieve pressure, such as a fast, decently long-ranged forward tilt for countering aerial approaches, a fast, long-lasting, and strong neutral aerial, and the 2nd fastest down aerial in the game. For attacks that are poorly spaced, he can opt for a grab, from which he has a down throw that can start combos up to mid-percentages, a back throw to set up edge-guards and KO at very high percentages while near the edge, and an up throw that can also KO at very high percentages (especially on platforms).

While his damage output per hit is not impressive, Meta Knight's speed and jumps allow him to rack up damage through combos at lower percentages and chase opponents through the air through to higher damages, punishing their escape options. His dash attack and down throw can combo into an up smash or aerials at lower damages, while his up aerial can link into other aerials or his up special. Even after his opponents are launched too far for a true combo, he can continue pressuring them by punishing their air dodges and landing options through effective use of his aerials, dash attack, and up tilt. Thanks to his flexible aerial mobility, he has little trouble chasing opponents offstage, and his aerials are well-suited to edge-guarding. Neutral aerial has a lingering hitbox and strong knockback, back aerial is fast with high power, and down aerial is a safe semi-spike than can gimp deceptively early.

Meta Knight's edge-guarding prowess is mainly courtesy of his recovery, which is arguably the best in the game. In addition to having five jumps and passable air speed, his special moveset is full of recovery options. Shuttle Loop, his up special and main recovery method, is fast, offers high vertical recovery, and has a large hitbox. Mach Tornado and Drill Rush travel far horizontally and with long-lasting active hitboxes, and the latter can be angled. Dimensional Cape allows Meta Knight to cover the distance in any direction while invisible, and offers the option to attack upon reappearing. Such options grant him the ability to vary his recovery to make it incredibly difficult to punish him offstage, let alone gimp him.","Meta Knight does have several weaknesses. His attacks generally have very few active frames, forcing him to be extremely precise with his moves lest his opponent punishes him. Despite being a lightweight, Meta Knight's falling speed, gravity and unusually round hurtbox make him highly vulnerable to combos, which combined with his low weight grants him poor overall endurance. Though he has a strong, safe finisher in his forward smash, a fast, powerful back aerial and up smash, he has difficulty landing these moves. Forward smash has high startup, making it easy to avoid, up smash is risky due to its ending lag, and back aerial has trouble connecting on grounded opponents. Furthermore, his up and back throws require rage and favorable positioning to KO at reasonable percentages. While Meta Knight's neutral game is fairly good, his lack of a projectile can be a thorn in his side, especially against zoning characters such as Mega Man.","Overall, Meta Knight is at his best so long as he has his opponent in a disadvantaged state, being able to rack up damage well at lower percentages, before keeping the pressure on them through juggles and edge-guards. A player must be patient in finding an opening, as he cannot sustain much damage himself, and such patience is especially needed when his foe is at high percentages where Meta Knight may find difficulty in landing his finishers."
Ice Climbers,8,5.505,"The Ice Climbers are ranked 51st out of 82 on the tier list, putting them at the top of the C+ tier. This is a significant drop from their 2nd out of 38 ranking in Brawl, and their worst placement in the series. The Ice Climbers serve as an unconventional close-quarters combat character due to their tag-team mechanic, which allows the duo to get away with certain unfavorable situations since the partner climber causes hitlag upon shielding or taking an attack. With proper execution, they possess some of the highest damage outputs of the entire cast in terms of both raw power and combo abilities, alongside solid frame data which allows them to take on an aggressive playstyle in spite of their poor mobility. The Climbers themselves aren't too susceptible to combos due to their short stature and low falling speed, while the partner climber is capable of disrupting combo attempts by their opponent. These advantages grant the Ice Climbers a formidable advantage state and punish game, as one mistake has the potential to lead to heavy damage or a zero-to-death combo, while also making their disadvantage state difficult to capitalize on if their opponent is unable to KO the partner climber quickly.

Despite all their strengths, the Ice Climbers have glaring flaws, mainly coming from the vulnerability of the partner Ice Climber and the loss of a few important tools between the transition from Brawl to Ultimate. Universal changes to prevent chain-grabbing make cheesing opponents much harder, especially since the partner climber cheers while the main climber throws an opponent. The partner climber was also made to panic when their leader is grabbed, making previously near-guaranteed grab escapes far less reliable. While they boast significant damage output and KO potential, it becomes heavily diminished if the partner is KO'd. This is not an uncommon occurance, either, since they take 1.02× more damage and knockback and deprioritize most attempts to defend themselves if separated. Their main recovery methods, Belay and Squall Hammer, are also drastically weakened if the partner is KO'd during the stock, to the point that Squall Hammer no longer provides any height and Belay becomes nearly useless. With these handicaps on the table, defending the partner climber is essential to the character's success. It is also notoriously difficult to use the duo at their strongest, as their most formidable advanced techniques, such as Desynching, require high technical skill and are difficult to perform consistently. Finally, the climbers have some innate issues such as a lack of range and an aforementioned low approach speed, alongside a mediocre out of shield game without the help of a partner.

Overall, the Ice Climbers have many unique advantages possessed by no other character, with an extremely high skill ceiling, many advanced techniques and potentially high payout; however, the loss of their most abusable tricks from previous games and the technical skill required to perform optimally with them have led to very low usage rates and representation at top-level play. Nonetheless, they are still a viable character and have seen some strong results thanks to the efforts of Big D.","The Ice Climbers are a pair of middleweights, (weighing 92 units, the same as Lucario, Wolf, Villager, Mythra, and Steve), with a small bodies, above average jumps, below average air speed and air acceleration, with low gravity and slow falling speed. Unique to a majority of the roster, they are the archetypical tag team fighters, though each Climber is a unique character in their own right. The partner (Nana by default) is controlled by a CPU and mimics what the leader (Popo by default) does with a six frame delay. As such, the player is essentially controlling two characters at the same time with slight tweaks; the partner has slightly higher mobility attributes, they will deal less damage, receive more damage, and are knocked back farther than the leader. When separated, the partner's AI takes control over their movement, and guides them back to the leader, ignoring most opponents in their path. While one Ice Climber deals underwhelming damage on their own, the two's power combined can make them very formidable.","Most of the Ice Climbers' grounded moveset is fairly quick and disjointed, allowing for versatile use. Their Forward tilt has impressive knockback growth, and can 2-frame and KO fellow middleweights at about 135%. Up tilt is short ranged, but one of the Ice Climbers' most useful moves, hitting multiple times with low knockback and dealing excellent damage. It also allows for a direct chain into a series of up aerials until about 115%, making it paramount in initiating combos and kill confirms. Down tilt is one of their quickest grounded moves, acting as a strong semi-spike at high percentages, and making follow-ups into tech-chases or edgeguards very easy. Dash attack sends opponents above the leader for quick transitions into aerials or desynced combos similarly to up tilt. However, it has very low knockback growth, making it only useful in starting combos.

Complimenting their tilts, the Ice Climbers' smash attacks are also very useful and excellent KO options. Forward smash is the duo's strongest smash, dealing impressive damage despite it's quick speed, and respectable knockback even at lower percentages, reliably KOing at about 70% at edge of the stage. Up smash is similarly powerful, but is slower in its start-up and ending. It hits in a wide area directly above the Ice Climbers, and can KO at about 120%. Down smash is the fastest but also the weakest of the duo's smash attacks. Each Climber swings in one direction, and can even catch large targets with both hits, but if only the leader is currently on stage, they become vulnerable to rolls due to the lack of a hitbox from behind.

The Ice Climbers' aerials are all strong options and are the basis of most of their combos. Neutral aerial has weak knockback, but is also quick to start, very safe, fairly damaging, and has a long-lasting hitbox, making it a threatening combo and gimping tool. Forward aerial is an overhead swing, which is slow and deceptively inactive, but deals immense damage and is the safest air attack in the game. The partner's version of the move has a sweetspot with a very strong spike that can net a KO impressively early offstage, and acts as the Ice Climbers' deadliest edgeguarding tool. Back aerial is an exceedingly useful move for its high speed, incredible safety, and staggering power. Up aerial is one of their best moves for a variety of scenarios. The move has excellent combo and juggling capabilities at low percent, and KO's most opponents at around 110-125% when used out of a down throw. Down aerial is a stall-then-fall that while risky to use, has respectable payoff for landing both on or off the stage, and even offers some combo potential when autocanceled.

The Ice Climbers' specials all have versatile uses. Neutral special has the duo each create a slab of ice that slides across the stage, shrinking as they melt. Unlike most projectiles, the ice acts more like a container or soccer ball in that the incoming projectile is completely tangible, tanking opposing projectiles even as strong as a Shadow Ball or Charge Beam. This allows the Ice Climbers to counter some projectile spam playstyles more easily. It can also freeze opponents, but not within realistic percents. If attacked with a strong enough attack, the projectile's ownership may change, allowing it to harm the Ice Climbers if collided with. When desynced, the duo can launch 1 Ice Shot at a time and in rapid successsion, making for a very dangerous edgeguard and even a frustrating zoning tool in certain matchups. Their side special, Squall Hammer, is a very respectable move for racking up damage and is relatively safe on shield due to the burst of movement during the final swing. With continued presses, the attack can also be used for recovery purposes, which puts them into a helpless state. It is also one of the easiest desync methods available to the player. Up special, Belay, covers an excellent distance, the partner Climber is completely intangible until pulling up the leader, and auto-grabs any ledges within range. The leader also has a very situational, but strong hitbox on the way up, allowing for a KO from the top blast zones, or a means to apply extra damage at the end of an aerial combo. Finally, down special, Blizzard, is a long-lasting ledgetrap and combo extender that freezes opponents in their tracks and deals huge amounts of damage at point blank range. Using the attack while an enemy is already frozen increases the freeze time slightly and can allow the duo to make space between them and their opponent if need be, or tack on extra damage while frozen. Specifically, this move is very useful when near the ledge, as it can cover most ledge getup options and freezing an opponent near the edges of a stage can make it easy to nudge them off without any means to escape. It also has priority over some other projectiles and can cancel them if the two collide. Overall, the duo's specials are all useful in various situations and can help to create openings for additional combos or surprise KO's.

An important part of playing Ice Climbers is learning how to consistently perform a tech called desyncing. Desyncing is an advanced technique that allows a player to manipulate the partner Ice Climber into acting with different timing than usual. At its most basic form, anytime the partner Ice Climber is not within a specific range of the leader, the partner's AI will take manual control of the partner and return it to the leader. During this time, none of the leader's inputs are read by the partner and it's AI inputs are prioritized until it has returned to the leader, and may act independently of the leader's current movements being performed. Using desyncs can allow for some remarkable combos and setups that are completely impossible with other fighters.","The removal of chain grabs (and by extension, wobbling) means that the duo's grab game has become more situational and in-line with the rest of the roster, limiting it's effectiveness. However, while it is not as potent as it once was, the Ice Climber's grab game is still respectable. The Ice Climber's grab itself has been vastly changed. For starters, only the leader grabs opponents, while the partner cheers. This means that the duo can no longer grab more than one opponent at a time. Additionally, the Ice Climber's grab is the shortest ranged grab in the game, making it difficult to grab an opponent in the first place. Forward throw is a basic throw that has moderately strong base knockback and causes tumble from 0%. But it's knockback growth is far too low to KO at realistic percents. Back throw also has strong base knockback with little growth, with less damage and a higher launch angle. Up throw continues this trend to an extreme degree, with virtually nonexistent knockback scaling but very high base knockback. High enough to take stocks at very low percentages or from light and floaty characters if used on a high enough platform on a stage such as Palutena's Temple. Down throw is by far the duo's best throw. It's main use is to initiate aerial combos, desync combos, and juggles, all of which can be devastating. Most of the Ice Climbers' aerials can be used for combos out of down throw, and the opponent's placement in air can make it difficult for them to escape from a combo once it has been started, especially if desynced. While all of their throws (except down throw) are normally subpar at best, any of them can be used to hold an opponent in place for a free hit when desynced.

Barring their situational projectile from Ice Shot, the Ice Climbers have no reliable projectile and can be easily camped out or their projectiles turned against them. The range of their moves is not great—despite being disjointed, their hammers' range can still come up short and can make for some bad matchups, such as Mythra or Sephiroth. Arguably, the changes that hurt the Ice Climbers most are the changes to grab mechanics in Ultimate. The added period of grab intangibility between grabs and the partner's lack of a grab makes the Ice Climbers' previously most potent tool, chain grabbing, nearly impossible. This significantly impedes their cheesing ability compared to Brawl or Melee and makes getting a stock off of a single grab much harder. Desyncing in itself can also have it's own drawbacks. An accidental desync off of up tilt or down throw may make it more difficult to follow-up with the duo's combos, or can even cause the partner's attack to miss entirely, hindering the duo's damage-racking capabilities. Desyncing can also leave the partner Ice Climber vulnerable because of the inconsistent reaction time between the leader and the partner; abilities such as dodging, and jumping can be significantly delayed, giving the opponent time to counterattack if properly read. They also retain most of the flaws that plagued them in Brawl and Melee, such as the difficulty in keeping the partner alive, severe handicaps when the partner is gone, sluggish aerial mobility, and susceptibility to camping, with the former issue being further pronounced as well.","Overall, the Ice Climbers can be intimidating and difficult to understand for new players, and combined with their subpar mobility and severe handicaps when the partner is lost are also considerable barriers of entry. However, learning the quirks of the pair, especially desyncing, can open an incredibly potent and powerful game plan. This includes long and relatively free-form combos, many being zero-to-death options—some even being true—as well as other unique setups and mix-ups that very few characters have any proper answers for."
Incineroar,8,5.45,"Incineroar is ranked 52nd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it in the C+ tier. Incineroar's main strength is its high damage power especially when fighting up close. It has several moves that have fast frame data and large hitboxes, which allows it to rack up damage quickly. In addition, Incineroar possesses several strong KO options, including three of its throws, Alolan Whip, and most of its aerials. All of its moves are further powered up thanks to Revenge, which allows Incineroar to not only tank a hit, but also deal even more damage the next time it attacks. Finally, Revenge and Incineroar's heavyweight allow it to survive to higher percents and take advantage of rage, making it even deadlier.

However, Incineroar also has several weaknesses, most notably its sluggish movement in both the air and on the ground; its walking and dashing speed are the slowest in the game. This gives Incineroar a poor neutral game, which combined with a lack of projectiles and somewhat short range, means it can have trouble getting close to those that can camp or outrange it. Furthermore, its KO moves are also somewhat inconsistent, as many of its moves either have sourspots that deal less damage and knockback or have poor knockback scaling; Revenge also does not last forever as there are several ways for it to disappear, including getting grabbed. This leads to Incineroar having to rely on either its throws or Alolan Whip to KO, which can become predictable. Finally, Incineroar's recovery is also lackluster due to Cross Chop's limited horizontal distance if not used above or near the stage, which can lead into a self-destruct if not positioned properly.

Overall, Incineroar is most effective when fighting and pressuring players up-close, but it has trouble against those that can outspeed or outrange it. Although initial results from Incineroar were lackluster, they have since noticeably improved thanks to the efforts of players such as Skyjay.","Incineroar draws many comparisons to some of the slowest, hardest-hitting fighters from throughout the history of the Super Smash Bros. series: it is a tall super heavyweight (being tied with Charizard as the 6th heaviest character) who has the 19th fastest falling speed, the 11th highest gravity, and average air acceleration. However, Incineroar is the overall slowest character in the game: it has the slowest walking and dashing speeds among the entire cast, the 10th slowest air speed, and it is tied for the 14th slowest initial dashing speed.","As a character that pays homage to professional wrestling, Incineroar's moveset boasts an abundance of single-hit attacks and throws, and its attacks have respectably large hitboxes for a close-range fighter of its mobility. Contrary to its sluggish movement and heavy weight, Incineroar's frame data is surprisingly above-average, with fairly quick start-up and respectable ending lag in spite of their impressive damage outputs. Unlike most other hard hitters, Incineroar's weaker attacks are fairly reliable combo starters that work at a myriad of percentages, giving its moveset an excellent amount of utility. Meanwhile, most of its stronger moves are greatly damaging and, in many cases, capable of KOing early. As expected of a super heavyweight, rage helps Incineroar KO even easier, and it is able to take advantage of it easily thanks to its quick falling speed, high gravity and aforementioned weight collectively granting it impressive endurance.

Unsurprisingly for a professional wrestling-inspired fighter, Incineroar's greatest asset is its excellent grab game. While Incineroar's grab range is average, its grabs are decently quick, linger longer than average (though its dash grab and pivot grab are slow), and it has one of the best sets of throws among the entire cast, all of which have respectable damage outputs. Its forward, back, and up throws are all powerful (with each being the strongest of their kind in the game in certain situations), whereas down throw is the core of its combo game. The latter can lead into various aerials (including down aerial, though its slow start-up makes it a mix-up), forward and dashing up smash at very low percentages, and Darkest Lariat. It can also potentially lead to a risky sacrificial KO with Cross Chop, which will always result in the opponent being KO'd first.

Forward throw has high knockback even at low percentages, making it an acceptable throw to set up an edgeguard at percentages where down throw won't combo anymore, and to KO at high percentages near the edge. Back throw, when performed at the edge, can potentially rival Ness' own back throw as the strongest throw in the game, and can KO light characters exceptionally early; however, due to its launch angle, lack of damage during the actual throw (as it consists of a hit before the opponent is thrown), and lackluster resistance to DI, it can be survived relatively easily if used mid-stage and kills far later than Ness' own throw if used in such a situation. Finally, up throw is Incineroar's most reliable KO throw due to being the strongest of its kind (only surpassed by Olimar's up throw with Blue Pikmin), and easily KOs earlier with the assistance of platforms and/or a low upper blast line. Overall, Incineroar has KO throws for any given situation, while also having a reliable combo starter.

Similarly to some of its fellow super heavyweights, Incineroar also possesses a unique grab; in this case, a command grab that functions as its side special, Alolan Whip. Upon execution, the player must press the attack or special button again after the throw initiates, and depending on timing, it has three outcomes: performing it early will result in a back body drop that has high vertical knockback that scales slowly, performing it too late will result in the opponent harmlessly bouncing back while damaging Incineroar, and performing it cleanly (as the opponent is about to collide with Incineroar) results in a lariat that is one of Incineroar's strongest moves, thanks to impressive horizontal knockback and a low launch angle. Even the early and failed versions of the move have their uses, with the back body drop KOing earlier while near the upper blast line, and the collision being usable to set up a reversal.

Incineroar's grounded moveset is a good example of its fast frame data for its high damage and power. Neutral attack is tied for the second fastest attack in Incineroar's moveset, and it is tied with King K. Rool, Ike, and Wario's neutral attacks for the third most damaging non-infinite neutral attack in the entire game, being surpassed only by Kazuya and Terry's. Forward tilt is the strongest in the game when sweetspotted, and is among Incineroar's best KO options on the ground due to its solid startup and semi-spike angle. Up tilt and down tilt serve similar purposes, being combo starters that can set up into Incineroar's other moves. Up tilt can link into itself at low percentages and into aerials at low to medium ones, and serves as an anti-air due to invincibility on Incineroar's head. Conversely, down tilt has impressive range, lowers Incineroar's hurtbox, and has excellent combo potential throughout all percentages, allowing combos into up tilt or up smash at low percentages or aerials at high percentages, including KO confirms into all its aerials (barring down aerial) or Darkest Lariat.

Dash attack's clean hitbox makes it is one of the strongest attacks of its kind in the game, but is mainly useful as a burst KO option when fresh, as Incineroar's slow speed can make it quite predictable. Finally, Incineroar's smash attacks have their own unique perks. Forward smash comes out surprisingly quickly, KOs extremely early when sweetspotted at the foot (being the 4th strongest when sweetspotted), and deals good shield damage. Up smash has a wide, consistently strong hitbox and grants intangibility, which make it useful for both anti-air tactics and KOing outright. Finally, down smash momentarily shifts Incineroar's hurtbox upwards, allowing it to dodge grabs, attacks, and even projectiles to act as a hard punish.

A few of Incineroar's aerial moves are also useful. Neutral aerial is also tied for its second fastest attack and has a large hitbox all-around. When sweetspotted, it can be used to KO offstage; if not, it can still function as a powerful combo starter, especially for an out of shield option. Up aerial is Incineroar's go-to aerial juggle option due to its wide hitbox and its capability of comboing from up and down tilts. Down aerial is a powerful meteor smash that can still KO even if the sourspot hits, and at lower percentages, sets the opponent up for a combo. Forward and back aerials are Incineroar's main way to KO opponents in the air, aside from Alolan Whip, thanks to their faster startup, with short hop forward aerial being a quick follow up to down tilt, and full hop forward aerial following down throw at higher percentages. Due to its aerials' power and decent enough recovery, Incineroar's edgeguarding game is respectable.

Incineroar's other special moves complete its moveset with a few versatile tools. Darkest Lariat is Incineroar's get-off-me option, possessing fast startup (being tied for neutral attack and neutral aerial as its second fastest attack), a long duration, transcendent priority throughout its hitboxes, invincibility on its arms, and a very strong early hit. Though its power gradually weakens over time, its perks allow it to outprioritize many moves (even weak projectiles) while hitting hard. Cross Chop is Incineroar's main recovery move; it can contest against other attacks due to its super armor during the start, and the descending hit deals high knockback. It is also a powerful combo finisher or sacrificial KO, as the initial descent's high base knockback allows it to gimp any character at 0% should the descending hit connect.

Finally, Revenge is a unique counterattack that retaliates with a weak hit, but stores a stackable power increase that affects Incineroar's next move; with a sufficiently strong buff, it grants exorbitantly powerful punishes, with moves such as its smashes, Darkest Lariat, Alolan Whip, and most infamously back throw turning into some of the strongest attacks in the game. While the buff lasts for one successful move, it is not lost should the attack hit an opponent's shield, making Incineroar's moves generally safe on block and can even result in the opponent's shield being broken if they keep shielding, leading to their doom. The buff does eventually go away if Incineroar uses too many moves without landing a hit, or if Incineroar itself is hit enough times, or if Incineroar is grabbed and thrown by an opponent. Revenge's buff is not lost upon hitting the failed version of Alolan Whip, but is lost upon hitting the first neutral attack if you do not complete the jab combo.","However, Incineroar's powerful abilities come at a severe cost. Its biggest issue comes from its poor neutral game. As mentioned before, Incineroar possesses abysmal mobility; when combined with a lack of a projectile, this makes it very easy to zone out and gives it a terrible approach. While the hitboxes on its moves are large, Incineroar's overall range remains somewhat short, so any sufficiently long-ranged projectile or disjointed range can be enough to keep Incineroar at bay. This is especially troublesome considering the cast is also full of characters with either greater mobility (such as Sonic), superior melee range (such as Lucina), good zoning games (such as Min Min), or in some cases, all three points (such as Wolf).

Further adding to this is Incineroar's poor air game: although moves like neutral aerial offer good utility, and forward and back aerials have the range to outspace opponents, none of Incineroar's aerials can autocancel from a short hop aside from up aerial (with forward aerial not autocanceling even from a full hop). This significantly limits their use in the neutral game, as their poor autocancel windows make them unable for approaching reliably. In bulk, this gives Incineroar one of the most lackluster neutral games of any character, being one of the characters with the most trouble at getting close to opponents to begin with, and forces it to heavily rely on bait-and-punish tactics in order to get in.

Another prominent issue is Incineroar's recovery. Cross Chop turns into an inevitable self-destruct if Incineroar is not directly below the edge or above stage level, which can lead to falling into predictable recovery paths, while Alolan Whip is very linear and has considerable ending lag. Incineroar's slow air speed, fast falling speed, and high gravity further compound its recovery issues. That said, Alolan Whip can intercept edgeguard attempts thanks to its non-inputted collision, allowing Incineroar to potentially reverse the situation. Furthermore, neither Cross Chop's descent nor Alolan Whip render Incineroar helpless, so Incineroar does have the ability to mix its recovery up when used in tandem with a directional air dodge and its midair jump, especially if it recovers from a high altitude, which adds to its impressive endurance. However, in a similar manner to Marth, if it doesn't have its double jump, Incineroar is highly vulnerable to being edgeguarded. By extension, any sufficiently strong semi-spike or meteor smash will almost certainly result in Incineroar being KO'd, and any combo that drags it offstage is usually fatal if it is not at a high enough altitude to recover.

Although its frame data gives it less of an issue breaking out of combos and rushdown tactics, its only reliable options to break through such tactics are neutral aerial, Darkest Lariat, and Revenge; all of which are exceptionally simple to punish predicted. If it is unable to break through combos, its slow mobility can leave it very vulnerable to constant aggression, in addition to being vulnerable to zoning and spacing. Its poor neutral game further contributes to this, as it can make it very difficult for Incineroar to even get back to a position where it can try to exploit the opponent's offense or defense. Despite its fast falling speed, Incineroar's slow air speed also leaves it vulnerable to juggling. Altogether, all these flaws collectively result in Incineroar having a poor disadvantage state.

Although its moveset has greatly damaging options, Incineroar has surprisingly inconsistent KO potential compared to many of its fellow super heavyweights. While its throws are among the strongest in the game and many of its other moves possess high knockback at low percentages as a result of their high base knockback, their knockback doesn't increase quickly due to their low knockback scaling. Notable examples of this are neutral and back aerials, back throw, Darkest Lariat and Alolan Whip's back body drop. Notably, some of Incineroar's moves require landing a sweetspot in order to attain their maximum knockback; notable cases include forward tilt (despite the sweetspot being the strongest in the game), forward smash, and both forward and back aerials.

Finally, disregarding its up throw, Incineroar has the worst vertical KO potential of the super heavyweights. Up tilt, up aerial, and Alolan Whip's back body drop all have lackluster power, while its up smash, while powerful, is relatively slow for an out of shield option. Revenge can alleviate this issue to a degree, but this requires Incineroar to read the opponent's attack in the first place. In addition, the buff is lost once it has successfully landed an attack, meaning that if Incineroar is forced to attack with one of its weaker moves, it is possible to waste the buff entirely. The buff can also be gradually lost by attacking Incineroar, by waiting after approximately 60 seconds (which is possible due to Incineroar's susceptibility to being outranged or camped), or outright wasted by throwing Incineroar via a regular grab or a command grab, further adding to its inconsistency.","In the end, Incineroar falls within the ""grappler"" playstyle archetype, which notoriously requires a very specific playstyle to be effective. Incineroar excels at taking advantage of close-range openings, where it can land powerful blows or start consistent combos that rack up damage quickly in only a few hits, all while being difficult for an opponent to punish due to its staying power, relative safety on shield and heavy punish abilities, making Incineroar very formidable once it wins the neutral game and gets in close. However, its significantly below-average mobility and relatively short range makes getting in its greatest hurdle, as most of the cast can simply run away and attack from a distance. Also, while it has an incredible overall damage output, it suffers inconsistent KO potential that is mostly reliant on its throws and side special, making it predictable when it comes to scoring a KO."
Pichu,8,5.28,"Pichu is ranked 53rd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it in the C+ tier. This is a significant improvement over its low tier placement in Melee, where it was ranked 22nd out of 26. Pichu boasts good combo ability and great KO power, with its fast falling speed aiding in its combo potential. It is also very hard to hit due to its small hurtbox and good mobility.

However, Pichu is hindered by critical flaws. Its biggest flaw is being the lightest character in the game. This combined with it taking recoil damage when using electric moves makes Pichu a ""glass cannon"" and can be KO'd earlier than any other character. Its fast falling speed makes it more susceptible to combos despite being so light.

Pichu's representation in tournaments has changed throughout Ultimate's metagame. At launch, Pichu was often seen as a contender for the best character in the game thanks to the drastic buffs it received, such as greatly reduced recoil damage and a fast forward tilt that can KO opponents around 100%, which led to a large playerbase spearheaded by VoiD and Nietono. However, update 3.1.0 gave Pichu major nerfs, making it more of a high-risk, high-reward character and leading many to deem it inferior to Pikachu. Despite this, Pichu continues to see moderate success from dedicated mains, most notably NaetorU.","Pichu is a character of extremes. As a clone of Pikachu, many of its attributes are similar, such as its even smaller size and quick mobility, though with a few noticeable differences. Pichu is the lightest character in the game, has fast walking and above average dashing speeds with average traction, above average jumping force, average air speed but being tied for the ninth highest air acceleration, and fast falling speed while being tied for the fifth highest gravity. However, it has the lowest fast fall multiplier in the game, causing its fast-falling speed to be average. Overall, these attributes give Pichu a slightly slower grounded approach than Pikachu, make its aerials not autocancel as easily and makes it more vulnerable to combos, but also gives it a much faster ground-to-air and air-to-ground approach, making its mobility as reliable as Pikachu's own.","Much like Pikachu, all of Pichu's moveset aspects are solid overall, possessing very fast frame data overall and great utility throughout its moveset. An example of this is its incredibly capable aerial game. Neutral aerial is Pichu's fastest out of shield option, on top of not having much ending or landing lag, making it a viable edgeguarding option. Forward aerial deals the highest damage of Pichu's aerials and has very strong combo potential, while only having decent recoil damage. Up aerial, while being Pichu's least damaging aerial, also retains very strong vertical combo capabilities. Down aerial is Pichu's main move to meteor smash, and the late hit also lasts for a long while, making it another great edgeguarding tool, while also having only decent recoil damage. Finally, back aerial deals less damage than forward aerial, but is also Pichu's strongest aerial, a very good edgeguarding tool, only has decent recoil damage like its forward and down aerials, and plays a major component on Pichu's looping combos; by repeatedly performing a full jump while using a back aerial and comboing into a tilt attack (most notably up tilt) to repeat the process, Pichu can zero-to-death combo the opponent, though the timing for each move is very strict.

Pichu's main (but not sole) ways to set up the opponent into its strong aerial game consist of its up and down tilts, and up and down throws: both tilts are excellent combo starters, with down tilt even comboing into aerials at very high percentages, while up and down throw allow Pichu to pummel the opponent for more damage due to them being followed up from a grab; up throw is also infamous for comboing into Thunder for a reliable KO set-up. This gives Pichu a strong combo game, with many ways to start, extend or end combos much like Pikachu, though due to its moves' nature, Pichu's combo game is usually shorter-lived in exchange for raw damage.

Aside from its up and down tilts, in regards to its grounded game, it also has some interesting and useful options: forward tilt trips opponents at low percentages, can 2-frame, and has above average power at high percentages, making it a very useful set-up tool. Forward smash has the highest power of its standard moveset, lasts for a long while and, due to its multi-hit nature, can KO at an even lower percentage. Up smash is a decent anti-air that leaves Pichu's ears intangible, though it lacks in power. On the other hand, Pichu's neutral attack is mainly used for locking opponents due to its very weak knockback, and dash attack is mostly used as a fast punish option and its low power can actually allow it to combo, though it can be risky. Its grab game is also decent - while its grabs are short-ranged, they are very fast and have the lowest ending lag in the game. As mentioned above, up and down throws have useful combo potential, with down throw usually reserved for horizontal combos, whereas up throw leads into vertical combos and can lead into Thunder as a KO set-up. Meanwhile, forward throw is Pichu's strongest throw, barely KOing at realistic percentages near the edge, which makes it a passable kill throw.

Pichu's special moveset is also varied and versatile. Thunder Jolt is a useful projectile that can reliably pressure an opponent's shield, on top of dealing low knockback and high damage (especially if started in the air). Its low ending lag also allows it to set-up into Pichu's moves if it lands during its last frames of activity. Thunder is Pichu's other projectile, though the lightning bolt itself doesn't deal much damage. As such, its primary purpose is to use the cloud's meteor smash properties to combo opponents into the shockwave part of the move when the bolt strikes Pichu - this deals the most damage to Pichu out of all its moves if this happens, so it should be used sparingly. Skull Bash and Agility serve as Pichu's recovery moves, and give it an amazing, long-distanced and unpredictable recovery - of the two, Agility deals high recoil damage if both dashes are used, but nevertheless travels an incredibly long distance and is very unpredictable due to each dash being able to be inputted in multiple directions, potentially making Pichu very hard to properly edgeguard or 2-frame. Skull Bash, on the other hand, is mostly used to extend Pichu's recovery, but it also ties in as part of Pichu's ""glass cannon"" playstyle as it can be charged; unlike Pikachu's own version, Pichu's fully charged Skull Bash deals immense knockback when fully charged, this being Pichu's strongest option out of a shield break.

Thanks to Pichu's attributes, one of its key strengths is its playstyle versatility - depending on the situation, it can make use of its moveset to adapt and play accordingly. Pichu's great mobility, compact size and useful projectile give it an impressive neutral game and make it slippery, allowing it to play defensively, by virtue of using a bait-and-punish oriented playstyle that allows it to avoid the opponent's attacks and gradually poke at them or outright break through their offense. However, if the situation arises, Pichu can nevertheless play very aggressively, as it also has one of the best advantage states in the game by virtue of its raw damage, excellent frame data and impressive combo ability, allowing it to pressure the opponent into commiting and retaliating accordingly, and almost all of its aerials have some sort of edgeguarding potential, which can quickly lead into a lost stock.","The primary difference between Pichu and Pikachu is the former's recoil damage on its electricity-based attacks. All of Pichu's attacks with an electric effect (forward tilt, forward and down smash attacks, forward, back and down aerials, forward throw, and all special moves except Thunder if the lightning bolt doesn't strike Pichu) deal recoil damage to itself, which makes it less feasible for Pichu to overuse these attacks. To compensate for this, many of Pichu's electric attacks have either increased damage, knockback (in some cases both), or versatility. This makes it less feasible for Pichu to overuse these attacks in situations that would require their use for best results, as it could put it in a spot where the opponent may even KO Pichu with a strong enough move. Conversely, it increases the reward Pichu would receive if it can land said moves, and due to these moves increasing Pichu's percentage, this means Pichu can make effective use of rage to KO an opponent with more ease, provided it can survive long enough. In spite of these strengths, Pichu still has a myriad of critical flaws, some of which are shared with Pikachu, but much more pronounced; the most notable of these is its immense frailty. While its offstage survivability is incredible thanks to its recovery's long distance and unpredictability, it has an awful survivability overall due to its ludicrously low weight, resulting in it being very easily KO'd off of a stray hit as long as the move is decently strong, and the existence of rage further pronounces this issue. Its very fast falling speed and gravity also leave it pretty vulnerable to combos (although its neutral air can remedy this issue), meaning that Pichu can also be easily put in KO percentage from one or two combos. Adding insult to injury, the recoil damage Pichu suffers from using its electric attacks can rack up very quickly if it overuses said moves, which is a flaw no other character has at the level of Pichu (some characters have only one move that can deal recoil damage), and can potentially throw it into a much more devastating position if it happens. As a result of all these issues, in spite of its excellent recovery and great mobility, Pichu's disadvantage state is poor, and if Pichu isn't able to KO the opponent, they can easily turn the tables on it, which can easily and quickly lead to a lost stock just as Pichu can potentially and quickly end one.

Another of Pichu's most notable flaws is that while its very small size results in it being slippery, it also results it in having deceptively short range (much shorter than Pikachu), requiring it to be pretty close to the opponent in order to rack up damage, which can be risky. Pichu's mobility, very quick frame data and useful projectile in Thunder Jolt can help remedy this, but the prevalence of many characters with faster mobility and/or disjoints can still give it trouble at approaching, and Thunder Jolt's recoil damage makes it unfeasible for Pichu to keep the opponent away for too much, forcing it to approach and further exacerbating its range issues, despite its reliable moveset. Furthermore, despite its moveset's higher consistency in regards to power, Pichu's range issues mean it can often have difficulty landing its otherwise powerful KO moves and set-ups, as the former aren't disjointed (with the sole exception, forward smash, still having short range), and the latter are very limited, possessing only up throw to Thunder at mid-high and high percentages, and down tilt to down aerial near the edge at mid-percentages. Pichu's edgeguarding ability, while respectable, pales in comparison to Pikachu's due to its attributes resulting in Pichu not having as much air time as Pikachu can, though this is slightly mitigated by its moves' stronger knockback.

Lastly, although its moveset is versatile, a few of Pichu's attacks still lack some notable kind of utility. Down smash, although covering on both sides of Pichu, has unremarkable range, deals recoil damage and unlike Pikachu, sends at a disappointing angle for KOing, with its higher power compared to Pikachu failing to compensate. Forward throw can have difficulty at KOing the opponent at realistic percentages due to the fact Pichu will usually find itself using it to set-up an edgeguard, whereas back throw's sole purpose is shared with forward throw.","Overall, like Pikachu, Pichu is best described as a quintessential glass cannon but sacrifices weight and attack range for more power and speed. While Pikachu can control the neutral game more aggressively and has more flexibility in its combos, Pichu is able to function in a variety of playstyles that range from a defensive, bait-and-punish oriented playstyle to a more aggressive, rushdown oriented one whenever it is needed. However, Pichu's atrocious endurance and recoil damage means that an aware opponent can dominate Pichu just as easily as it can also dominate the opponent. While both characters have similar playstyles, they differ significantly in execution, as Pichu's recoil damage requires the player to make very mindful use of their resources at hand. When mastered, however, a skilled Pichu can potentially end stocks in a fingersnap before they can end its own."
Chrom,8,5.222,"Chrom is ranked 54th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the C+ tier. This is significantly lower than his base fighter Roy, who is ranked 19th out of 82 on the current tier list and placed in the A tier. As with Roy, Chrom is blessed with an effective set of tools which work well with Ultimate's more aggressive pace: his combination of strong mobility and falling speed, quick frame data for a swordsman, good hitboxes on his attacks, and overall high damage-to-frame data ratio (courtesy of the weighted average of Roy's sweetspots and sourspots being rather high) grant him a powerful advantage state once the opportunity presents itself. Chrom also possesses one of the best neutral attacks in the game that has a myriad of uses (including being able to hit some opponents hanging from ledge) and a strong set of special attacks, including a unique up special in Soaring Slash, which is an effective damage dealer, decent out of shield option, and is infamous for its powerful meteor smash, allowing it to KO ledge-hanging opponents at 0% or function as a powerful sacrificial KO.

However, despite his myriad of strengths, the drastic difference in tier placement compared to Roy is due to Chrom's infamously poor recovery. Soaring Slash is Chrom's only recovery move and acts like Aether, offering very little horizontal distance compared to Roy's Blazer; it also lacks protection outside of its high super armor frames on startup, and cannot snap the ledge till Chrom begins falling. This makes it incredibly easy to gimp Chrom, as an opponent can simply bat him away with any attack (including holding down certain neutral attacks) or counterattack his recovery. As a result, he has one of the worst recoveries in the game despite his high air speed, making him highly dependable on recovery mixups and his air dodge; this also translates to him having a very poor disadvantage state, especially offstage. Finally, his balanced blade sacrifices the stronger, polarized sweetspots of Roy's sword, meaning he often has to win more neutral exchanges to compensate for the lack of stronger punishes, while his KO ability is still weaker than Roy's, most notably with Double-Edge Dance.

Initially, Chrom was highly regarded and considered one of the best swordfighters in the game, with high representation across all levels during the first year of Ultimate. However, after several nerfs to Soaring Slash and the community learning the matchup, his overall representation dropped significantly due to the playerbase taking advantage of his fragile offstage presence. This has resulted in Chrom struggling to make the same impact as he did in the early metagame.","As the Echo Fighter of Roy, Chrom's moveset and animations are primarily based on those of Roy, and his attributes are identical as well, with excellent yet polarized overall mobility (very fast dashing, air, and falling speeds, alongside a very effective dash dance, but a slightly above-average walking speed, slow air acceleration and a low midair jump) and good frame data for a weapon user. As a result, Chrom shares an almost similar gameplan: he is mainly a rushdown character, who aims to overwhelm his enemy by closing the distance quickly with fast movement. However, Chrom's primary difference is his sword's lack of a sweetspot and sourspot, making him more oriented towards spacing out his opponents at the cost of having lower damage output and knockback up close, compared to Roy (who focuses more on getting up close to his opponent for very hard hits). Chrom also notably lacks any of Roy's distinctive flame effects and reverse-gripped animations, and his forward tilt moves him slightly forward. Finally, Chrom's up special is completely different compared to Roy's, as Soaring Slash functions much like Aether compared to Blazer, and is more effective at racking up damage than KOing while onstage; it can even act as a niche sacrificial KO at extremely low percents out of a forward aerial, and otherwise acts as a deterrent for edge-guarding that Roy lacks. However, this is only effective if Chrom has a stock lead since he is usually KOed first.","Since Chrom's lack of a sweetspot makes his unique attribute similar to his daughter Lucina (who acts as the non-sweetspot/sourspot equivalent of Marth), Chrom's benefits are also somewhat identical to hers: they both share the trait of having the weighted average of their original fighter's damage numbers. As a result, they have more consistent combos, edgeguarding and KO potential than their base characters, and their attacks are significantly safer on shield and on hit than Marth and Roy's sourspots, at the cost of losing out on stronger sweetspots that can end stocks early. However, as Roy's sweetspots and sourspots are extremely polarized in power, Chrom's damage and knockback averages end up being higher-than-average, giving him an overall powerful offense. Additionally, he arguably benefits more from his balanced blade than Lucina does, since Roy's weaknesses are his reliance on getting extremely close and extremely ineffective sourspots; as a result, Chrom suffers less from Roy's main flaws, allowing him to both space and fight up close very effectively. In terms of general capabilities compared to Lucina directly, Chrom possesses faster overall speed and stronger grounded attacks, in exchange for lower jump height, faster falling speed, and weaker aerials. This makes him more capable than Lucina while on or moving along the ground, but drastically less versatile in the air and especially off-stage (mirroring the differences between Roy and Marth, respectively).","Despite his array of strengths, Chrom also has very polarized weaknesses. While Chrom's retention of Roy's high air speed grants him decent survivability with his second jump, his overall recovery and off-stage endurance is notoriously weak, even when compared to Roy, as Soaring Slash grants almost no horizontal distance and only snaps to ledge once he begins the downward slash, making it susceptible to counterattacks and sufficiently long hitboxes. This, combined with Chrom's low jump height and fast falling speed, results in him having one of the worst recoveries in the game, and also one of the most easily affected by semi-spikes and gimps. His poor recovery is only somewhat remedied by his aforementioned high air speed and the presence of his air dodge, which combined with his second jump, allows him to return to stage surprisingly frequently without the need for Soaring Slash. Despite this, Chrom's air dodge remains unsafe even though he relies on it more than other characters for survival. Additionally, he shares similar flaws with Roy: his excellent mobility is offset by a complete lack of projectile-denying tools, making him vulnerable to camping from a handful of characters, and his fast falling speed and low air acceleration makes him vulnerable to combos and juggles (though he has some good tools for escaping such combos, such as neutral aerial and falling up aerial).","Overall, it is fair to describe Chrom as an amalgam of previous Fire Emblem characters, taking bits and pieces from not just Roy, but also Lucina and Marth by extension, Ike, and Corrin to a much lesser extent. Chrom is a very accessible and effective character and provides for a completely different playstyle from Roy despite their shared attributes and moves. His aim is to strike a balance between aggression and patience, as he has the mobility, range, and damage necessary to switch between gameplans on the fly. However, his very weak recovery mandates that players avoid being thrown off-stage and maintain stage control at all times, as not only is he vulnerable to getting edgeguarded and gimped, but can sometimes also end up in a spot where he is unable to recover at all.

All in all, Chrom's strengths outweigh his weaknesses. He was viewed extremely positively in the early competitive scene after the release of Ultimate, had multiple dedicated mains such as Rivers and Mr.R who represented him in tournaments, and was a popular secondary pick for many high-level players."
Marth,8,5.199,"Marth is ranked 55th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the C+ tier. This is a large drop from his placement of 11th/12th out of 54 in SSB4 where he was tied with Ryu, and is the second largest drop for a veteran in the transition from SSB4 to Ultimate, and is his worst placement in the series to date. This is also a significant drop compared to his Echo Fighter, Lucina, who is currently ranked 28th out of 82 and is placed in the A- tier. This drastic difference in tier placement is due to Marth's reliance on landing tipper hits to get KOs. This combined with Ultimate's faster engine and removal of certain microspacing techniques (such as perfect pivoting) makes it more inconsistent at landing those sweetspots and netting KOs, while his sourspots, though effective for setting up combos and tech-chases, struggle to take stocks even at high percentages. Lucina's attacks, on the other hand, deal the same amount of damage and knockback regardless of where on her sword the attack lands, giving her more consistent KO capabilities.","Marth is considered to be emblematic of swordfighters; his playstyle revolves around spacing utilizing his unique signature tipper mechanic to deal high damage and knockback at a distance from his opponent. He is a low-middle weight swordfighter boasting high overall mobility, notably sporting the fastest walking speed in the game (tied with his Echo Fighter, Lucina), a fast dashing speed coupled with the 6th fastest initial dash, average air speed, above-average air acceleration, moderate falling speed, and low gravity.","Marth's playstyle, as in of his other playable appearances, revolves around effective spacing, due to his aforementioned tipper mechanic granting most of his sword attacks more damage and knockback near the tip of the sword, although he can now utilize his sourspot hitboxes more effectively for setting up combos and tech-chases due to his increased mobility and reduced landing lag on aerials, repurposing his former heavily spacing focused playstyle from SSB4 into a more dynamic one that utilizes sourspots to initiate kill confirms and extend combos at higher percents to complement his efficient spacing game. His above average frame data, paired with his high mobility, grant him an effective although linear approach against characters that outrange him with longer disjoints or projectiles, whereas his multiple attacks with low startup and wide range all-around allow Marth to space around brawlers with lower range, this combination of traits permit him to adapt to different gameplans and characters.

Marth maintains well above-average KO potential in addition to his speed and maneuverability, with his sweet spotted attacks boasting impressive damage and knockback. His forward tilt is one of his most reliable tools on the ground, possessing a good range and a sweetspot that is easy to hit with, especially above Marth. It is good for closing out stocks as it can KO as early as 95% near the edge while remaining relatively safe. His down tilt is a safe poking tool when spaced and sets up a tech chase situation starting at 60%, and his up tilt covers a relatively wide area around Marth himself and is among the strongest of its kind in the game. Dash attack possesses extraordinarily high base knockback, KO'ing most fighters when landed at the very edge at roughly 65%, even if forward tilt surpasses it in most other scenarios. His aerials also possess high damage and knockback when sweetspotted, and combined with his aerial maneuverability, grant him a respectable air game. When tippered, his forward smash can KO before 40% next to the ledge while uncharged, making it one of the most deceptively powerful forward smashes in the game, while his up smash can KO as early as 60%, earlier if Marth is standing on a platform. The meteor smash of his down aerial, while requiring exact timing and spacing to connect, can not only gimp recoveries but also bounce opponents off the ground in such a way that it can immediately chain into tippered attacks such as forward and up smash at medium percentages, and aerials at higher percentages. His tipper mechanic benefits greatly from stages with low platforms such as Battlefield, allowing Marth to tipper with much more ease against opponents using forward tilt, up tilt, and especially his forward smash by covering said platforms with mostly the tipper areas of said attacks. Higher platforms follow a similar pattern except with his aerials, most notably up aerial. In essence, Marth can make a single correct move at the correct time to cut an opponent's stock short suddenly and very early, especially when playing close to the edge.

While Marth's tipper has great KO power, the larger hitboxes of his sourspots provide benefits as well; thanks to their lower damage and knockback, they allow him to effectively combo into attacks one after another at a wider range of percentages. Most commonly, sourspotted neutral aerial when short hopped repeatedly allows Marth to carry an opponent across the stage at low percentages and rack up damage, and up tilt sets up into aerial-based combos and juggles if it connects late. His neutral aerial's first hit also acts as an effective combo starter and extender when sourspotted and landed as close to the ground as possible, as well as his up aerial. He also benefits from being one of the few characters in the game who can outright KO through effective play of his neutral and spacing game; essentially, while Marth's neutral reward is not as rewarding or damaging as some characters, Marth has the ability to win neutral exchanges with relative ease and safety, as well as having consistent set-ups and follow-ups.

Marth's advantage state as a whole is considerably strong. His combination of good speed and range give him powerful juggling capabilities, as he can easily dash to where a falling opponent might land and catch them with his wide attacks, especially his up tilt and up aerial. His fast and disjointed hitboxes also allow him to challenge the opponent's falling attacks safely, and his tipper only further complements this. Because of this, Marth has an easy time keeping opponents in the air and racking up damage with his up tilt and powerful up aerial. These traits also grant him strong edgeguarding abilities, as his wide aerials can cover enemy movement well, and when tippered can outright KO offstage opponents thanks to their power. Moreover, his general floatiness also allows him to recover back to the stage after edgeguarding attempts fairly safely.

Marth's special moveset provides interesting options as well; his neutral special, the aptly named Shield Breaker, deals very high shield damage, even when uncharged, and is useful for covering rolls and landings. It's best used while descending from the air when the opponent is most likely to expect a simple aerial and shield accordingly, and can even be used off-stage to challenge opponents that shield next to the edge intending to cover Marth's ledge recovery options. Dancing Blade is a four-hit combo that can be used to punish sidesteps and rolls, as well as effectively rack up damage. The final upward hit immediately puts the opponent into a disadvantaged state, and the final downward hits deal high damage. The final neutral hit can serve as an effective KOing option at higher percents, but if it successfully tippers, it can KO as early as 70% at the edge with no rage. More situationally, the first hit of Dancing Blade by itself can be used as a knowledge check on opponents: although it cannot truly combo into anything other than the rest of the move, if an opponent is not prepped to escape after getting hit by the near-instant strike, it can be used extend strings in the air, be followed up with the first hit of neutral aerial, and assist in gimping recoveries by interrupting unprepared opponents off-stage. However, those who are aware of the gap after the hit can escape with relative ease, so its use is not recommended at higher level. Dolphin Slash has quick startup, provides slight intangibility during its startup frames, is relatively strong when it first comes out and has high knockback scaling. These attributes make it an excellent out-of-shield option and combo breaker, whilst also giving him an easy and reliable combo finisher and KO option. It is also Marth's primary method of recovery, as its speed can make it difficult to intercept, and it can stage spike reckless edge guarders. Lastly, Counter provides him with the capability to reverse attacks with 1.2× the damage, KOing if the attack was strong enough; it can also be used against opponents with slow and easily predictable recoveries.","Despite his strengths, Marth has some notable weaknesses. The most severe of these is his extreme reliance on tippers and spacing ability, which gives him a subpar up-close game at higher percents, and makes it more difficult for Marth to KO and threaten faster characters such as Pikachu, Fox, and Sonic, who rapidly pass in and out of Marth's 'Goldilocks zone' of tippers when engaging him at close range. The low shieldstun and hitstun generated by non-tippered moves make it possible for opponents to act out quicker than he can, causing Marth to struggle against shields if his attacks are improperly spaced, and Shield Breaker is highly punishable if predicted. His tipper mechanic can equally disadvantage him when attempting to KO, as his attacks do not generate much knockback if not spaced properly, making his KO potential very inconsistent without proper spacing and understanding of his effect ranges (most notably with forward smash, forward tilt, and aerials). Lastly, his edgeguarding ability, though strong, is flawed, both due to the need for tippers to definitively gimp recoveries and the moderately high ending lag on his aerials. As a result, Marth is reliant on being in a certain distance for his moves to be safe while retaining the neutral. Additionally, unlike in past iterations, Marth can have a fairly difficult time consistently landing his tipper sweetspots to begin with as a result of the faster engine and alterations to his hitboxes that made his tipper smaller. His ability to KO effectively other than a raw tippered move in neutral exists in rare and difficult setups that are heavily affected by individual character hurtboxes, player DI, and Marth's own rage, and eventually disappear once his opponent reaches an especially high percentage. This leaves him very little choice but to 'fish' for an aforementioned tipper, a sourspotted smash attack, any of his specials, or an edgeguard scenario, up until the point where the opponent is at an extreme percentage that even a non-tippered stray hit or up throw can KO; This phenomenon is referred to by the community as ""Marthritis"", and with the exception of the edgeguard scenario, most of these aforementioned moves remain unsafe if the sourspot is shielded or the move whiffs completely, leaving him an easy target for punishment.

Compounding the difficulty Marth experiences trying to land his tipper, the increased knockback granted by tippered attacks can actually conflict with moves that consist of multiple hits, causing them to fail to correctly sweetspot or even connect on all hits unless at very specific percentages and ranges. These include his neutral attack, neutral aerial, and most notoriously Dancing Blade; Due to the changes to Dancing Blade, it is much harder for an opponent to fall or DI out of the sequence but it is also harder for Marth specifically to land more than one tipper in any use of the move. Should he tipper any earlier hits of these aforementioned attacks, it is highly likely that the opponent will be knocked too far away for the later ones to even connect. This means that Marth must initiate each of those moves from the sourspotted areas in order for them to function correctly, and carefully time the strikes of Dancing Blade to tipper the finishers. As a result, Dancing Blade's high KO potential is offset by not only the difficulty of landing the tippered finisher, but also by it intrinsically having lower damage output than other characters' version of the move.

Marth's weak throws tie into his polarized KO power. Except for up throw, they have low knockback scaling, preventing them from KOing at realistic percents, while up throw can only KO starting at 170% when Marth has no rage. His other throws are somewhat lackluster; aside from having a fairly fast pummel, Marth's throws deal low damage and have high base knockback, making them poor for combos and damage-racking outside of down throw leading into an aerial until high percents. However, it should be noted that the high base knockback of his throws allow Marth to take advantage of his good edgeguarding capability, especially at the edge.

Another notable weakness is Marth's difficulty in escaping from juggles, despite being good at juggling opponents himself; his air speed is average at best, his gravity is fairly low, his weight is slightly below-average and his tall hurtbox provides an easy target. Dolphin Slash is his only reliable combo breaker, but as it leaves him helpless, it can inadvertently put him in an even worse position. Also, while Counter can be used defensively, it leaves Marth extremely vulnerable to punishment should it whiff. Marth also has little defense against juggling, as his aerials are ineffective at relieving pressure; though his attacks have quick startup and decent range, many of them come with high ending lag, their large sourspots are fairly weak compared to most other aerials, and they also suffer from short hitbox durations. Additionally, being a solely sword-based character, Marth's neutral game suffers from his complete lack of a projectile, and he can sometimes struggle against projectile-heavy characters and playstyles; however, his combination of high mobility, good range and decent frame data helps to alleviate this issue.

Marth himself is somewhat vulnerable to edgeguarding, though he has options for mix-ups with his recovery. Dolphin Slash is his only reliable vertical recovery option, and while it is still a threat to edgeguarders due to its speed, frame 1 intangibility and high stage spike ability, its path is linear and its distance fixed, making it fairly predictable. Additionally, since this move grants little horizontal distance, Marth is vulnerable to semi-spikes. While Shield Breaker can aid his horizontal recovery, it covers little distance without charging and does not halt his existing vertical momentum either. Marth is also heavily reliant on his double jump and directional air dodge for mix-ups in his recovery, and is in significant danger if offstage without either of them.
","Overall, Marth's strengths outweigh his weaknesses. While his reliance on spacing and overall safety hinders him in many ways, his high overall mobility, long and disjointed range, above-average frame data and good damage output make up for it, while his punishes are decently strong overall even if the stronger ones are fairly inconsistent. In general, while he is usually considered a good character, he is also seen as weaker and more difficult to use than his Echo Fighter Lucina. Marth has received among the worst results and representation in the metagame of Ultimate; even if he is not weak, he is considered to be outclassed by Lucina competitively, who shares many of Marth's strengths with lesser weaknesses. However, starting from updates 8.0.0 and 12.0.0, players have started to have a more positive outlook on Marth as a number of his tipper hitboxes were buffed, making them easier to land and overall making him a more consistent character. This has led to the gap between him and Lucina becoming somewhat less polarizing, with some players noting his potential to rise up in the metagame."
Link,8,5.143,"Link is currently ranked 56th out of 82 characters on the current tier list, placing him in the C+ tier. Despite being buffed overall from SSB4, this is a moderate drop from his placement in SSB4, where he ranked 31st out of 54. Link has solid disjointed range, courtesy of the iconic Master Sword, with several strong KO moves that utilize it, such as his forward tilt, dash attack, forward aerial, his smash attacks, up aerial, down aerial, and Spin Attack. Link's non-sword moves also have amazing utility. His neutral aerial, in particular, is notorious for being a staple of his neutral game, being a strong landing, spacing, edgeguarding, and pressure tool. Link also has a strong projectile game, with his Remote Bomb acting as a dynamic tool for mindgames, item combos, edgeguarding, recovering, and ledgetrapping that he can activate at any time. His Boomerang is also good at catching approaches and keeping opponents in check. Overall, Link has a strong zoning game with powerful KO tools should his opponent get up close to him.

However, Link has several weaknesses. He is on the slower side of the spectrum, so he struggles to keep up with faster characters who can get around his projectiles. Link's sword moves also have below-average frame data, which can cause him to be overwhelmed by faster moves. Link is also a heavyweight, making him one of the easiest characters to combo and juggle and keep in disadvantage. His recovery is also exploitable, as his Spin Attack travels in a predictable path, leaving his head vulnerable to spikes or lingering hitboxes.

Overall, Link has the tools to keep out his opponents and KO them at fairly low percentages, but should his defenses be infiltrated, it makes it difficult for him to get back in neutral. Link had promising results in the early metagame thanks to strong performances from T; however, his results and representation declined significantly in the post-online metagame, with only a few notable performances from players such as Rido and Kyon.","Link is a heavyweight swordsman that sports powerful attacks and long range via the Master Sword. Link sports an above-average walking speed, the 15th slowest dashing speed, above-average initial dash, the 10th slowest air speed (tied with Diddy Kong), the 4th slowest air acceleration, average gravity, above-average falling speed, the 6th highest fast falling speed, and above-average traction. Lastly, Link has among the lowest jumps in the game. Overall, these stats render Link's mobility generally poor. Like his alternate timeline counterparts and Hero, Link possesses two shields instead of just one. In Link's case, he wields the Hylian Shield, which blocks opposing projectiles if he is standing still, walking, or crouching. Like Toon Link, Link also wields his respective version of the Master Sword, which sports overall better range compared to the previous installment.","In addition to overall long range, Link's grounded moveset features other merits: neutral attack deals above-average damage and has a reliable semi-spike in its third hit. Forward tilt boasts both above-average damage and knockback, which in tandem with its good range and low ending lag, makes for a great spacing option. Up tilt also deals above-average damage which, in tandem with its low ending lag and large range, makes it a great juggling option. Down tilt possesses low ending lag, satisfactory damage, and high vertical knockback; altogether, these traits render it a great combo starter for devastating chains of aerial attacks. Dash attack possesses high damage, knockback, range, and traveling distance, all of which make it very useful for KOs at around 110%.

Link's KO potential shines strongly in his smash attacks, all of which deal high damage and knockback. Forward smash has large range and a tipper on the first hit. His forward smash is a natural combo without activating the tip. When Link is at 0% or when he has full stamina in a stamina battle, the first swing of his forward smash releases a sword beam that can be charged to improve damage and distance. His up smash hits three times, has wide range, and average startup; these attributes, in tandem with up smash's high damage and knockback, makes it very reliable for both damage-racking and KOing. His down smash deals the lowest damage out of Link's smash attacks, but its decent speed and vertical trajectory make it a very useful edgeguarding option; down smash's edgeguarding capabilities are further bolstered through its second hit's strongest hitbox, which is a reliable semi-spike.

Link's aerial attacks are useful in their own rights. His neutral aerial is a sex kick with low all-around lag and good damage output overall, and is able to lock and combo with other aerial and ground attacks; forward aerial sports long range, low landing lag, and high damage, making it one of Link's most reliable KOing options; back aerial is Link's fastest aerial in terms of startup lag, being able to combo into itself at low percents and other attacks at higher percents; up aerial deals high damage, a long-lasting hitbox, and great range, making it reliable for both KOs and juggles; down aerial is similar to up aerial in some regards, but its clean hit instead functions as a reliable meteor smash that KOs at alarmingly early percents (its grounded hit KOs at 125%). Down aerial can be used to bounce off of opponents, which can actually aid Link's recovery.

Although Link's close combat capabilities are excellent, he shines primarily when it comes to his projectiles: arrows from his bow, Boomerang, and Remote Bomb. Bow and Arrows has Link fire an arrow straight ahead, which can be spammed to some degree; it can be charged, greatly increasing its damage, knockback, and distance, making it a good gimping and pressuring tool. Link's neutral special is unique in the fact that his arrows briefly linger on the ground when landing, allowing him to pick them up and fire two arrows simultaneously; Link is able to deal more damage and knockback, aiding neutral special's KO potential.

Boomerang travels decently far and deals good damage, which can be further exploited by smash tapping the move: the Boomerang's distance and damage are increased as a result. Boomerang also launches opponents vertically with high base knockback on its way forward, and launches opponents towards Link on its way back. When coupled with its ability to be angled up and down, Boomerang is a flexible combo starter and approaching option.

Remote Bomb can be thrown as an item, potentially being able to initiate combos by chaining it with other attacks. This is further bolstered by the Remote Bomb's 30-second time limit, which gives it plenty of time to be abused as a projectile. The Bomb's detonation has large range and deals decent damage and knockback, with enough power to KO opponents at 180%. Although Link can be harmed by his own bomb's explosion, he can exploit its vertical knockback offstage as a means of aiding his recovery. This also allows him to launch himself way past the ledge without going into freefall, avoiding being edge-trapped.

Link's primary recovery move and most offensive special attack is Spin Attack. The move's grounded version boasts decent damage and knockback, good range, and is a fast out of shield option, giving it decent utility; however, it can be charged, increasing its damage output and knockback, significantly improving its KO ability. Aerial Spin Attack is instead a multi-hitting series of sword slashes that gains respectable vertical distance and has good knockback on its last hit, making it good for KOing near the upper blast line.","However, like all fighters, Link has some weaknesses. Although he has noticeably better mobility than his predecessors, Link's mobility is still inconsistent and somewhat on the poor side. Despite his fast walking speed, his dash is only marginally faster, making it very sluggish and unreliable for approaching (with foxtrotting being the only way of mitigating this issue). Link's air speed and air acceleration are both notoriously poor, making his air game solely reliant on the traits of his aerial attacks. On a related note, Link's recovery is burdened by the combination of his low jumps and high falling speed, his aforementioned poor air speed and air acceleration, and the merely average travel distance of Spin Attack. Due to lacking a Hookshot or a Clawshot in his moveset, Link lacks both a tether recovery and another spacing option, the former of which further hinders his recovery.

Link's lack of a Hookshot/Clawshot also results in his grab game differing entirely: due to grabbing opponents with his bare hands, his grab speed is significantly quicker at the cost of his grab having much less range. Thus, Link's grab game is much more aggressive and up-close. Despite being a swordsman, Link's grab game is decent overall. His pummel is fast and his down throw is a reliable combo starter into moves like up tilt, up smash, neutral aerial and up aerial. Although Link's up throw will semi-spike bystanders, it has minimal KO potential. Finally, his forward and back throws deal minimal damage and while both are best suited for setting up edgeguards, only forward throw is decent in that regard.","Overall, Link is a flexible zoner character; while his long-distance projectiles and disjointed hitboxes make him play somewhat defensively for much of the match, his excellent out-of-shield options and KO power allow him to close in on his opponents with the right timing and deal large amounts of damage very quickly. However, Link players must be cautious to not play recklessly due to his below-average frame data and mobility, as many other characters can make it difficult for him to utilize his options with their superior speed. Throughout Ultimate's lifespan, Link has garnered great results from many different players, although his results did go down slightly after the first few months of the game's release."
Lucario,8,5.058,"Lucario is ranked 57th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it in the C+ tier. This is a significant drop from its 17th out of 54 placement in SSB4 and is its worst placement in the series.","In terms of physical attributes, Lucario is a middleweight fighter (same weight as Ice Climbers, Mythra, Steve, Wolf, and Villager, making it on the lower end of middleweights) with average height, a below-average walking speed and an average running speed, a very fast initial dash (tied for 5th fastest with Bowser, Mewtwo, Marth, and Lucina), above-average traction, very high air speed (6th fastest in this category), above-average air acceleration and falling speed, and below-average gravity; Lucario can also crawl, wall jump, and wall cling. These traits make Lucario a somewhat floaty character who can maintain aerial presence for a long time, be it onstage or offstage, while also having decent mobility and control on the ground due to its fast dashing speed and above-average traction; collectively, Lucario's overall mobility meanders between average and above-average.","Lucario's most notable strength comes from its unique fighter ability, Aura, in which damage and knockback multipliers are applied to all of its attacks depending on how much damage Lucario has taken, with the multipliers being directly proportional to its percent; the multiplier is x0.66 at 0%, increases to x1.0 (base power) at 65%, and caps out at 190% with a multiplier of x1.67. Aura multipliers are also affected by differences in stocks, with it increasing when Lucario is behind in stocks and decreasing when it is ahead. Additionally, Aura also affects the properties of its special moves; as Aura increases, the size of Aura Sphere becomes larger when charging and when fired, the blast from Force Palm has greater range, and Extreme Speed travels a greater distance. In turn, this ability can allow Lucario to rack up large amounts of damage and kill at very early percents when it has taken a lot of damage, making it useful as a comeback mechanic when Lucario is falling behind. It should be noted that Aura also stacks with rage, further augmenting the increased knockback of Lucario's moves at very high percents, though to a lesser extent than in the previous game.

In terms of its grounded moveset, while its neutral attack has little to no use due to having low damage output relative to its speed, dealing only 9% at base power despite coming out at frame 5 (for reference, faster jabs such as Mario's come out frame 2 and deal 8% while slower jabs such as Bayonetta's come out frame 9 and deal 21%) its other grounded moves have some utility; forward tilt has its use as a spacing tool due its ability to be angled and kills middleweights at 145% on the edge of Final Destination at base power, up tilt is a combo starter that can combo into itself at low percents and into neutral aerial, forward aerial, and up aerial at mid percents, down tilt can combo into dash attack and forward aerial at mid percents while also having its use as a spacing tool, and dash attack, while not being very useful for killing, is a decent burst option due to it coming out fast as well as because of its fast initial dash.

Its smash attacks also have their uses as disjointed kill options. Up smash has its use as an anti-air that kills middleweights at 105% at base power and it can also hit grounded opponents up close with its initial scooping hitbox, making it a situational out of shield option against laggy moves. Down smash covers Lucario from both sides and kills middleweights at 115% from center stage at base power. Forward smash has the greatest amount of kill power and horizontal range out of its smash attacks, being able to kill middleweights at 90% from center stage at base power while also having the potential to be safe on shield if spaced well. Its grab game also has utility. Up throw and down throw can be used as combo starters, with the former being able to combo into forward aerial at low percents and neutral aerial at mid percents (as well as up aerial on bigger characters), while the latter can combo into forward aerial at low percents (with down throw > forward air > forward air > up air being its most damaging combo at low percents). Forward throw and back throw don't have much use outside of being positional throws, though the latter can have a situational use as a late kill throw.

Lucario's aerial moveset also has good utility. Neutral aerial hits twice, covers Lucario from both sides and has a good amount of active frames, making it a useful edgeguarding tool that compliments its ability to maintain aerial presence. It can also combo into up tilt, down tilt, and dash attack at low and mid percents when SHFF'd. Forward aerial is fast and can combo into itself when SHFF'd, up aerial and back aerial are vertical and horizontal kill options, with the former killing middleweights at 110% at base power near the top blast zone and having situational combo potential into itself and neutral aerial when SHFF'd, and the latter kills at 115% from base power at center stage while also being slightly disjointed. Down aerial is also unique in its uses; it is its fastest aerial at frame 4, allowing it to be an out of shield option, it stalls its movements which allows it to mix up its disadvantage and edgeguarding, and it has its use as a kill option, killing middleweights at 135% from the edge of Final Destination at base power.

Lucario's special moveset sports great versatility as well. Aura Sphere is useful as a projectile and as a kill option, with a fully charged one killing middleweights at 150% from center stage at base power. In addition, the move also maintains a hitbox behind Lucario as it is being charged, giving it use as an approach mixup and sometimes as a situational kill confirm into back aerial. Force Palm is unique in the fact that it functions as a ranged blast from a distance and as a command grab at point blank range, giving it use as an out of shield option and a kill option, as it kills middleweights at 140% at base power from center stage. Extreme Speed, being its primary recovery option, travels a good distance and has a hitbox that enables it to be used as a mixup for onstage recoveries. Finally, Double Team is a counter that has greater utility than conventional counters; the distance the move covers allows Lucario to punish the opponent when countering a projectile, and the fact that the strength of the counter is based on Aura as opposed to the strength of the countered move allows it to kill middleweights at 115% at base power regardless of the move being countered.

All in all, these traits give Lucario a decent neutral game with Aura Sphere, good advantage state, edgeguarding capabilities, and a decent disadvantage state with its fast air mobility and two specials that can be B-reversed and versatile special moves, as outside of Mewtwo, Lucario is the only character that has both a chargeable projectile that can be stored and a command grab in their special moveset, not to mention that Lucario is the only character who has a projectile that has a hitbox during its charging animation as well as a move that functions as both a command grab and a ranged attack with Force Palm. In addition, Aura gives Lucario the potential to take early stocks and to comeback from percent and stock deficits.","However, Lucario also has notable flaws. Ironically, a lot of its flaws come from its most notable strength, Aura, as the fluctuating nature of the ability makes it inconsistent in a few ways. One thing Aura makes inconsistent is how Lucario is rewarded for winning neutral; because Aura has a x0.66 multiplier, this means that Lucario starts off the match and fresh stocks as a character with extremely poor damage output, meaning that it will have to win neutral many times and/or maintain advantage really well just to rack up decent damage with little to no Aura all while the opponent can have an easier time closing those percent deficits due to not being burdened with a damage reducing multiplier. In addition to having the issue of being burdened by low Aura, it is also difficult for Lucario to make the most out of high Aura because Lucario's average weight makes it very unlikely for it to be alive at very high percents, much less at 190% for him to use the highest Aura multiplier of x1.67, and then losing a stock only becomes even worse because it puts Lucario back to being burdened by the x0.66 multiplier; this essentially means that Lucario is only at its strongest state when it is also at its most vulnerable state. Aura's inconsistency not only affects the consistency in which it can rack up damage, but also the consistency at which it can kill; the kill percents mentioned earlier are at base power when Lucario has already taken at least 65%, meaning that those kill percents are far higher when its Aura is lower, and while it can also kill at far lower percents with high Aura, the consistency of that is also hindered by its average weight. Another thing that Aura makes inconsistent is its combo game; while other characters have their bread and butter combos and kill confirms at certain percent ranges, Lucario's combos and confirms are far less consistent because the knockback of moves will keep fluctuating as Aura increases, making it so those combos at low and mid percents won't always land due to Aura giving moves too much knockback.

Outside of Aura's inconsistencies, another flaw Lucario has revolves around its frame data, as while it isn't as slow as characters like Ganondorf and King K. Rool, it is still somewhat sluggish; its jab (frame 5) and forward tilt (frame 12) are slow relative to other jabs and forward tilts while also having poor damage output and/or kill power unless it is at high Aura, all of its smash attacks come out at frame 15 or slower, and all of its aerials barring forward aerial and down aerial come out at frame 10 or slower, with such issues making its already inconsistent kill power even more inconsistent on top of the fact that its throws outside of Force Palm have very little kill power unless it is at high Aura. Its poor frame data also hinders its ability to approach, which is also worsened by its somewhat floaty nature.

Finally, Lucario's special moveset, despite being versatile, doesn't come without its flaws, as Force Palm has hitbox issues that cause the command grab to not be triggered when at close range, and Double Team can put Lucario deeper in disadvantage if used hastily. However, the most glaring flaw with its special moveset is its recovery; while Extreme Speed travels fast and covers good distance, the fact that it has 46 frames of startup makes it vulnerable to edgeguarding. Additionally, the move is also inconsistent due to not always grabbing the ledge as well as the fact that the speed and distance change with Aura, making it possible to overshoot its recovery and self destruct.","Overall, Lucario is a very high risk, high reward character. Essentially being most powerful when most vulnerable, players need to know when to play recklessly and when to play carefully. Either kill sooner and get killed sooner, or kill later and get killed later. Despite the strengths it has in its special moveset and in its aerial and offstage game as well as the potential to secure early stocks and comebacks with high Aura, the potency of these strengths are complicated by Aura's many inconsistencies and its damage reducing multiplier when at percents less than 65%. On top of that, its below-average frame data and floaty nature makes its approaches inconsistent and its recovery is exploitable due to its long start-up."
Mii Gunner,8,5.041,"The Mii Gunner is ranked 58th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing them in the C+ tier. This is a major improvement from their Super Smash Bros. 4 iteration, which was 53rd out of 57 on that game's third tier list before ultimately going unranked on the fourth.","The Mii Gunner has been redesigned to be the slow, yet durable combatant of the three Mii Fighters. They are tied with Link, Yoshi, Captain Falcon, and Min Min in terms of weight, possess an average walking speed, the 5th slowest dashing speed, and 14th slowest air speed in the game. As with the other two Mii Fighter types, the Gunner has access to 12 different special moves: Charge Blast, Laser Blaze, and Grenade Launch (Neutral Special), Flame Pillar, Stealth Burst, and Gunner Missile (Side Special), Lunar Launch, Cannon Jump Kick, and Arm Rocket (Up Special), and Echo Reflector, Bomb Drop, and Absorbing Vortex (Down Special).","Like the other Mii Fighters, one of the primary strengths of the Mii Gunner is their diverse set of versatile specials. As the long range and projectile-heavy Mii Fighter, many of their specials excel at neutralizing approaches, racking up damage, edgeguarding, and shield pressure from a distance. Charge Blast is a very good KO'ing option which is extremely consistent, quick, and powerful when fully charged. Gunner Missile is good at both spacing and keeping enemies out. The Super variant deals a solid bit of damage and knockback while the Homing variant can wall out approaches and also help the Gunner initiate approaches of their own. Laser Blaze racks up decent damage while also causing flinching, making it a valuable tool similar to Falco's Blaster. Finally, Flame Pillar and Bomb Drop are both good tools for ledgetrapping and setting up kill confirms. A bomb drop at mid-high percentages can reliably confirm into back aerial while an opponent trapped in Flame Pillar can be combo'd into a fully charged Charge Blast. Additionally, the Mii Gunner can also further solidify their defensive playstyle with the usage of Echo Reflector and Absorbing Vortex, both of which aid in countering other campy or projectile-based characters.

Accompanying the Mii Gunner's vast collection of zoning specials is a very interesting and varying set of normals. While many of the Gunner's normals suffer from mild ending lag, they either possess high KO'ing power or range. Forward smash and up aerial are both among the longest-ranged moves in the game (the latter of which can secure very early KO's at the top of the blast line and the former being an excellent way of reading rolls and covering landing options). Forward tilt and neutral aerial are good tools to push pressuring opponents off of them. Forward aerial is a very useful move, which not only can edgeguard and space opponents from a distance due to it being a projectile, but it also pushes Mii Gunner (referred to as ""gundashing""), which helps mitigate the Mii Gunner's lacking mobility and recovery. Alongside the aforementioned moves are a slew of moves that have respectable KO'ing power such as up smash, up tilt, down tilt, down smash, and back aerial.

Lastly, the Mii Gunner has adequate choices for recovery. With the exception of Cannon Jump Kick, Lunar Launch and Arm Rocket both provide a fantastic amount of distance, especially Arm Rocket, which has far more control both horizontally and vertically. This combined with their heavy weight gives the Mii Gunner a decent ability to survive at higher percents.","Mii Gunner does not come without their flaws. While many of their moves have tremendous range or KO'ing power, most of them are very laggy. This is especially prominent with their up and down tilts, which both have decent start up but significant ending lag while moves that are fast such as forward tilt and neutral air have poor range and KO potential. As a result, they struggle to acquire reliable KOs outside of a fully charged Charge Blast. Laser Blaze is a fairly slow and easily interceptable projectile; Grenade Launch travels in a very slow and short-ranged arc that no longer can be charged or controlled; Flame Pillar has relatively substantial lag on both ends and doesn't last as long as other flame-arc moves; and Bomb Drop can be hit back to the Gunner, making it a poor choice to use against opponents with disjoints.

As mentioned before, the Mii Gunner has terrible mobility. Their air speed, dashing speed, and initial dashing speed are among the slowest in the game, making them a very sluggish fighter both on the ground and in the air outside of gundashing. Additionally, their status as a heavyweight makes them very easy to combo despite their decent survivability, and while their recoveries are good, they do not come without their weaknesses. Arm Rocket, despite its fantastic mobility and distance, possesses no damaging hitbox and allows the Mii Gunner to be easily gimped by opponents with attacks that can reverse the Mii Gunner such as Mario and the Mii Swordfighter; Lunar Launch, while in possession of good vertical distance and a relatively powerful projectile, has poor horizontal distance; and Cannon Jump Kick trades recovery potential for offensive power, providing very little distance both horizontally and vertically while also being slow and easily intercepted.","Overall, the Mii Gunner is a jack-of-all-trades amalgamation of various projectile-based fighters. The ability to mix and match several different special moves adds a unique layer of versatility by allowing several different playstyles for the same basic character, making Mii Gunner among the most unpredictable to fight against. However, all of the customizable special moves have fatal flaws to prevent them from being overpowered and/or are inferior versions of similar moves other fighters possess. Their strengths do marginally outweigh their weaknesses, and as a result, Mii Gunner is a fighter that excels at walling out opponents while struggling up close. Their multitude of projectiles provides them with countless options to keep opponents away, rack up damage, and edgeguard. However, they must be mindful and extremely careful, as one mistake can cause them to take a huge chunk of damage. They are a relatively simple character to pick up with a playstyle similar to Samus and can be a potent zoner, but due to their aforementioned weaknesses, they are considered to be worse at zoning than characters such as Samus, Snake, and the Belmonts."
Bowser,8,5.003,"Bowser is ranked 59th out of 82 on the tier list, placing him in the C+ tier. This is a noticeable drop from his placement in SSB4, where he was ranked 24th out of 54.","Bowser, as per tradition, is a super heavyweight and the heaviest character in the game. This is reflected by some of his attributes, which fit in the mold of his archetype: he has a slow walking speed (16th slowest in the game), very quick falling and fast-falling speeds (tied with Bayonetta for the 19th fastest), slow air acceleration, high gravity, and immensely powerful attacks. However, Bowser sports otherwise excellent mobility, as his air speed is well above average (tied with Sheik, Duck Hunt, Lucas, Cloud, and Mega Man as the 20th fastest in the game), his initial dash is extremely quick, and he also boasts a surprisingly fast dashing speed (the 22nd fastest in the game) that surpasses most of his fellow heavyweights, even outrunning characters such as Marth, Inkling, Toon Link, and Pichu. Due to his above average dashing speed and initial dash, Bowser sports a respectable dash-dance.","Unsurprisingly, Bowser's most notable trait is his impressive endurance, being among the best in the game. His extreme weight makes him very difficult to launch and KO, while his fast falling speed and high gravity make it trivial to stay grounded. Bolstering his endurance is his varied forms of armor; Bowser has damage-based percentage armor on the startup of all his tilts and smash attacks. Bowser also has an attribute called ""Tough Guy,"" which is constantly active knockback-based armor that allows Bowser to withstand a handful of weak attacks, like rapid jabs and weak projectiles. This lets him tank and approach effectively while at low percents, and allows him to simply break through any rapid jab with a powerful attack, acting as a hard punish. Supplementing Bowser's endurance is the immense damage and power his moveset provides, as all of his moves deal high damage, and most of them have KO potential. Rage further helps Bowser, as he can easily take advantage of being at KO percentage to easily turn the tables on the opponent should they make one single error.

Bowser's grounded game has numerous merits, thanks to the combination of his damage-based armor, the damage and power it boasts, and its speed all around. All of his tilt attacks render his limbs intangible during their active hitboxes, which makes them pseudo-disjointed, while some of his smash attacks give his body parts invincibility. These traits further aid Bowser in spacing or beating out attacks, which can lead to very hard punishes. Forward tilt is decently fast and very powerful, able to KO before 150% and even earlier at the edge. It can be angled and, when angled down, can 2-frame punish most recovery moves. Up tilt has very good coverage all around Bowser and is not only his most powerful tilt attack but one of the strongest up tilts in the game, killing middleweights below 125%. Forward smash, while being his slowest smash attack, is the second strongest in the game (killing at around 60% from center stage uncharged) and renders his legs invincible, allowing it to outprioritize other moves. Up smash is fast relative to its power (coming out on frame 16 while being the strongest up smash in the game when sweetspotted), has invincibility on his entire shell and a hitbox on landing that provides safety, making it an excellent anti-air option. Down smash is Bowser's fastest smash attack, coming out on frame 12, being especially fast for its power as well (being able to KO around 70% at the edge of a stage) and hits both sides, making it an ideal punish option out of a perfect shield, despite its very high ending lag.

His aerial moveset also has useful options. Forward aerial is considered his best one, as it has relatively average landing lag alongside above average damage and knockback (which allows it to KO below 115% from the edge), great range with good coverage above and below him (comparable to swordfighters with similar ""frontal slash"" moves), and can combo on landing. Back aerial deals great damage and has extremely high knockback scaling (killing at around 100% from center stage and as early as 60% by the edge), and is very fast for an aerial of its caliber. Both aerials autocancel in a short hop, making them good coverage options at the edge, and their power also makes them terrific edgeguarding options. Neutral aerial deals massive damage if all of its hits connect (although this is very difficult to accomplish), being the second most damaging aerial attack in the entire game, and using it while landing gives it combo potential and KO setups at high percentages. Finally, up aerial renders Bowser's head intangible and is a fairly useful vertical kill move due to its high damage output and knockback, although it is typically situational given its short range.

Bowser's grab game is also rather versatile, thanks to its combination of damage and utility. While his grab is rather slow, it is among the longest reaching non-tether grabs in the game. His forward and back throws serve a similar purpose as kill throws; both are among the strongest in the game. Up throw is a useful combo throw which can lead to extremely damaging combos at low to medium-high percentages. Finally, his down throw is the third most damaging throw in the entire game, but due to its lack of KO potential, it is mostly used to refresh other moves and put the opponent in an unfavorable position offstage.

His special moveset commands a balance of both raw damage racking and kill options, all of which are versatile. On one hand, in terms of damage racking, Fire Breath is Bowser's ""projectile"" move, spewing flames that peter over time but recharge when the move is not in use. The flames deal massive damage and shieldstun, and unlike other projectiles, don't deal negative shield damage, so the move will always deal full damage to shields. When angled correctly, it can also hit ledge hanging characters and even 2-frame punish many recoveries, making it a good edgeguarding tool, although it can be countered if Bowser is too close to the ledge. At maximum range, the flames don't cause opponents to flinch, which allows Bowser a very dangerous damage racking option that won't break an opponent's dazed state (similar to Piranha Plant's Poison Breath or Fox's Blaster), allowing him to KO opponents as early as 0% if he successfully breaks their shield. His up special, Whirling Fortress, is Bowser's fastest attack at frame 6 on the ground; combined with its multi-hit nature and considerable horizontal mobility, this makes it an effective ""get-off-me"" and out of shield option. In the air, it is Bowser's primary recovery move, traveling decent vertical distance and massive horizontal distance, and has decent KO potential to boot. On the other hand, in terms of kill options, Flying Slam is the fastest command grab in the game (and tied with Whirling Fortress as Bowser's fastest attack at frame 6), and has incredible power if it grabs an opponent, killing around 120%, or earlier if he has rage. Since he leaps a high distance in the air, he can land on platforms, which can put him at a much more advantageous position and KO opponents even earlier. It can also be B-reversed, allowing Bowser to bypass shields unexpectedly, even in midair. Bowser Bomb deals fantastic vertical knockback and can even meteor smash at the start of its descent; it also deals extreme shield damage, allowing it to break a full shield if properly landed. These two moves, combined with Bowser's fantastic damage output, allows him to play mindgames with the opponent's shield.

Thanks to his great damage output, once Bowser has gained the advantage, his abundance of options for racking up damage allows Bowser to put the opponent at a gradually worse and worse position before sealing a stock. Unlike previous incarnations, Bowser also doesn't waver in terms of mobility, which means that, if the opponent is at a disadvantage, he can close in on the distance to his opponent, read their options and mantain the advantage. His consistent shield breaking prowess, with several moves at his disposal being able to heavily dent shields, means that if the opponent chooses the incorrect defensive option, they can be put in an even worse position, since his moveset is also full of kill options, most notably his forward smash.","However, in spite of his potent strengths, Bowser is not without his drawbacks. Despite his excellent options to rack up damage, his frame data is below average overall, which means that faster opponents can beat Bowser to the punch, and he is susceptible to being punished if his attacks are whiffed, shielded, or dodged. This ties in with Bowser's biggest weakness, which is his great vulnerability to heavy pressure of any kind. Bowser's combination of extremely high weight, large hurtboxes, fast falling speed, and high gravity makes him exceptionally susceptible to combos, and as such, characters like Captain Falcon, Mario, Pikachu, and Ryu can easily punish and combo him for large amounts of damage if he makes a single mistake. His below average frame data and frame 4 air dodge also results in an inability to effectively break out of combos. Although Bowser has remarkable range, his is mostly melee-based, so characters with weapons that grant them disjointed reach (like Marth, Cloud, and Shulk) can prove to be difficult for him to overcome, especially if they're able to space their moves efficiently. As Bowser essentially lacks a projectile (due to Fire Breath's range being short and strict to Bowser's frame), he can also have difficulty at approaching characters with strong zoning games, like Min Min, Samus, and Toon Link, especially since their melee range also tends to be comparable to his. The latter two methods of pressure also give Bowser trouble at properly approaching.

Landing with Bowser while he's being juggled can prove a notable issue despite his high gravity and fast falling speed, as his most notable options for landing, down aerial and Bowser Bomb, are laggy and predictable due to being stall-then-fall moves. Landing with his other aerials, although seemingly not an issue thanks to his forward aerial's range and knockback, can also prove a liability due to none of them being particularly safe on shield. His rolls are also short-distanced, and his techs are slow and have low durations, which makes him prone to tech-chasing. Bowser's recovery, while serviceable and much better than most of the other super heavies, tends to be mediocre in practice, as it is rather slow and doesn't offer Bowser as much protection as other recovery moves would; as a result, he is particularly vulnerable to being edgeguarded, especially by counters or moves that can 2-frame. His out of shield game, despite being consistent, is nevertheless predictable due to Whirling Fortress being his most viable option out of shield; all other options can be punished or do not have the proper range to punish well-spaced moves. Moveover, his damage-based armor (on his grounded attacks) and universal knockback-based armor (from his signature Tough Guy ability) fails to compensate for all of this, as they do not compensate for his lack of medium-ranged and zoning or counterzoning options. Altogether, despite his great mobility and excellent tools to punish melee-focused options making him not as susceptible as his fellow super heavyweight contemporaries, Bowser's defensive game remains just as poor overall compared to them, due to him being so susceptible to pressure.

Other weaknesses include a few of Bowser's moves either lacking proper utility or being largely outclassed by his other options. Neutral attack is Bowser's third fastest attack overall, the first hit can lock (although this is best suited for bulkier characters), and the second hit can beat spotdodge attempts; however, it is largely outclassed by his Whirling Fortress, since the latter is faster and can be used out of shield. His down tilt, while being equally fast as forward tilt while dealing more damage, has less utility for 2-framing due to its weaker knockback and it is much more punishable, especially on shield. Up aerial, while powerful and relatively quick, has poor range and moderate endlag and landing lag, meaning that up tilt is normally considered a superior vertical KO option. Down aerial, while being Bowser's second strongest aerial and the third strongest meteor smash in the game when hit cleanly, has numerous weaknesses, including its slow startup, stall-then-fall nature, and extreme ending and landing lag. This means that its offstage utility is severely hampered when compared to other down aerials of its nature, such as those of Mr. Game & Watch and Sonic. While forward throw still has some utility due to its strong knockback, it lacks the damage output of his down throw and the quick release of his back throw, making it somewhat outclassed in terms of KO power and damage. Lastly, while his down special, Bowser Bomb, deals immense damage and is infamous for instantly breaking shields, its slow aerial startup and extreme endlag make it unsuitable for landing and it is agreed to be his worst special as a result.","In the end, Bowser can be considered to be the ""all-rounder"" of super heavyweights. While his playstyle remains largely bait-and-punish oriented compared to previous incarnations of him, his attributes make him more of a ""lightning bruiser"" on this regard. Bowser has among the most raw damage output, highest KO power, and best shield breaking capabilities of any character, while still retaining great range and movement speed, meaning that once he gains the upper hand, it can be practically impossible to break his pressure if he continuously reacts properly. With hard-hitting and relatively laggy moves like his, Bowser is anything but a character who strings together long combos; rather, he usually just needs four or five good hits in order to rack up high amounts of damage, and eventually score KOs. Even some of Bowser's moves that have little KO potential still have some kind of utility, so even in areas where Bowser cannot outright KO, he can continue to dish out large amounts of damage in a short amount of time, and his moveset contains very well-rounded and versatile options to achieve this. However, his moveset is so lopsided for netting damage and easy KOs that he outright lacks options to properly approach or to combat heavy pressure. This means that, if Bowser makes one wrong move, he can be easily pressured as much as he can do such to the opponent, and his lack of safe and fast moves, lack of zoning and counterzoning options, and unreliable mid-ranged options can leave him zoned out and comboed easily by his opponent, leaving him with little to no room to breathe. Regardless, Bowser’s strengths outweigh his weaknesses and he is widely considered to be the best super heavyweight in the game, though overall he is considered mid-tier by most professionals. Although his representation and results have not matched those of other top and high tier characters, they have nevertheless been very respectable thanks to players such as LeoN, Lunamado, and DarkThunder, who have demonstrated that, in the right hands, Bowser can dominate opponents with his pressuring tools at high level play."
Jigglypuff,8,4.992,"Jigglypuff is ranked 60th out of 82 in the current Ultimate tier list, putting it at the end of the C+ tier. This is a great improvement over its last place ranking in Smash 4. Jigglypuff's strength lies in its superb aerial game, which is the result of long-lasting aerials that, combined with its excellent air mobility and multiple jumps, can be used to wall out its opponents offstage. Jigglypuff also has a much easier time killing due to its quicker KO options, new KO setups, and more reliable Rest combos. Rest itself has more knockback and less endlag if Jigglypuff lands it, allowing Jigglypuff to escape potential punishes. Finally, Jigglypuff's ground game has been improved: its jab can confirm into back aerial or dash attack at high percents, its up tilt can combo into its other aerials and even Rest in some scenarios, and its forward throw can send opponents at a low angle, making it easier for Jigglypuff to utilize its strong edgeguards.

However, Jigglypuff still possesses several flaws. It still lacks range on its moveset, which causes it to struggle against opponents with long/disjointed range and characters who excel in camping. Its neutral game still remains poor due to its horrible grounded mobility and linear options to approach its opponent, and it can have a difficult time hitting opponents that outspeed it. Finally, Jigglypuff's survivability is poor due to its low weight making it susceptible to KOs at an earlier percent than normal, and as a result, it is susceptible to trades at higher percents.

Overall, Jigglypuff's weaknesses balance out its strengths as it is a character who struggles a lot to get in, but has the ability to beat just about any character with only a few openings. Despite the character's inconsistencies and a small playerbase, Jigglypuff has seen strong representation at a major level thanks to players such as BassMage and Senra.","Jigglypuff is a character of extremes, as evident with its attributes: it has the 2nd fastest air speed, the highest air acceleration, the slowest falling speed, and the lowest gravity. These attributes make Jigglypuff a very mobile character in the air. However, it also has the 3rd slowest walk and run speed, the 6th slowest initial-dash, the 2nd lowest weight and jump force, and the 7th lowest traction. Collectively, these attributes render Jigglypuff unable to quickly traverse the stage on foot without relying on foxtrotting, and susceptible to early KOs. To make up for its low jumping force, however, it has five midair jumps, which further enhance its aerial evasiveness. Its combination of light weight and floatiness results in Jigglypuff being fairly difficult to combo compared to most other characters, but conversely makes it fairly difficult for it to land onstage and escape a juggle without being forced to retreat offstage and grab the ledge.","Jigglypuff's main strength is its formidable air game. Excluding back aerial, all of its aerial attacks have lingering hitboxes, and back air especially is safe on shield when properly spaced. Their duration is the primary reason Jigglypuff is deceptively difficult to challenge in the air, as opponents will most likely collide within an attack's final frames if they attempt to challenge its moves. All of its aerials, aside from up aerial, also have enough range to be spaced effectively thanks to Jigglypuff's aerial mobility, allowing it to zone and approach opponents safely in the air. Each of Jigglypuff's aerials also have their own distinct strengths. Neutral aerial is its fastest aerial and a fairly strong sex kick, even when stale, and can easily gimp poor recoveries due to its late hitbox being sufficiently strong enough to do so. Due to its speed and power, it also works as a good out of shield or approach option, and its long duration allows it to break combos quite effectively. Forward aerial has the second-weakest knockback of Jigglypuff's aerials, but this grants it good combo potential in return. It can easily force opponents off-stage and is the main component of the wall of pain technique: once an opponent is launched off-stage, Jigglypuff can follow up with several other forward aerials until they reach the blast zone, where Jigglypuff can finish the opponent off with another forward or a neutral aerial. Both neutral air and forward air can also lock with their late hits, and generally both attacks linger for a long time and are very useful for edgeguarding. Back aerial is Jigglypuff's strongest aerial, an effective KOing option, and has a remarkable range, given Jigglypuff's small size. It even possesses some combo potential at very low percents, and the move in general greatly benefits from techniques like RAR. Similar to Marth, Roy, Lucina, and Chrom, the move also has the interesting trait of completely turning Jigglypuff around after its use. It is also safe on shield due to its high damage output and above-average hitlag, though it is also Jigglypuff's slowest aerial, making it a bit predictable. It also has a sweetspot closer to Jigglypuff's body, although this is difficult to hit due to the sourspot farther away taking priority. Up aerial has a deceptively long-lasting hitbox, which can be problematic for any opponent that has issues dealing with juggling, and it is also a situational finisher near the upper blast line that combos into most of its toolkit if used while landing. Lastly, down aerial can be used as a highly damaging out of shield option, a combo tool, and a pressuring option, and has low ending lag. It can sometimes also work as an anti-juggling option against characters with slow aerial mobility or moves. As well, landing with it can lead into various other moves, allowing Jigglypuff to take stocks incredibly early, especially when factoring in the move's ability to autocancel and link into itself.

Jigglypuff's unmatched floatiness, exceptional air speed, multiple jumps, and strong air game give it a tremendous off-stage presence. Due to lacking a traditional recovery move, its recovery is fairly susceptible to gimping if it has used its jumps, though its other attributes make its recovery very effective regardless. Its fast air acceleration also allows it to mix-up against opponents that attempt to edgeguard it. With the aid of Pound, it can also stall its recovery and protect its landing. Jigglypuff is infamously fearsome at edgeguarding: with proper spacing and good timing, it can gimp even the farthest distanced recoveries without being put at risk; Cloud, Chrom, Ganondorf, Dr. Mario, Little Mac, and Min Min are perhaps the most susceptible to its edgeguarding, as their recoveries lack both speed and resilience, causing their performances against Jigglypuff to revolve around maintaining stage control as much as possible.

This is not to render its grounded moveset useless, however, as it is surprisingly versatile for such an air-based character. Jigglypuff's neutral attack possesses incredible speed, can lock, and combos into its aforementioned back air. It also combos into dash attack, which can KO at unusually low percentages. Forward tilt is fast and damaging, and when angled down, is its fastest option for hitting an opponent that is grabbing the ledge. Up tilt is relatively quick and possesses surprisingly good combo potential, whilst still maintaining the utility of a KO move at later percents. Down tilt is a semi-spike with high base knockback that can easily gimp many recoveries when used at the ledge, whilst also putting opponents in a bad position on stage should they miss their tech. As for its smash attacks, forward smash has surprisingly high knockback scaling, while down smash has intangibility on Jigglypuff's legs and the lowest launch angle of any other conventional semi-spike, causing characters with weaker recoveries to die at very low percents. It also possesses surprisingly fast grabs, and its down throw is a solid damage dealer which greatly benefits from throw invincibility, especially in certain matchups or when playing in doubles. Its greatest grounded move, however, is its buffed forward throw, which sends opponents at a low angle when used near the ledge. This is a fantastic tool to have for a character that forces opponents to shield so often, especially due to down aerial's ability to combo directly into a grab. The angle forward throw sends at forces the opponent to pick an option, burn a resource, or both, making the edgeguarding guessing game much easier for the Jigglypuff player. As a cherry on top, at low percents, it can put opponents in a bad position onstage if they miss their tech, very comparatively to their down tilt.

Jigglypuff also possesses an infamous trump card in Rest. Rest has powerful vertical knockback at all percentages, to the point where it can reliably KO any character at 70%, but KOs most characters as early as 50%. It hits on frame 2 with a flower effect and has full intangibility until Jigglypuff closes its eyes. In addition to being an incredible punishment option, the threat of Rest forces opponents to be very careful when using laggy moves, especially due to Jigglypuff's ability to perform an occasionally situational true combo into it. One of the best ways to confirm a Rest is with forward aerial: hitting with the move's final frames will lead into an unavoidable Rest, which becomes even more potent if used in the air or with high rage. Depending on the opponent's falling speed, a jump may be necessary to reach them. Another reliable way to confirm one is by landing with up aerial: should Jigglypuff land immediately after hitting the opponent, Rest can be landed without fail. This combo works optimally on platforms due to its limited percentage range and its ability to KO as early as 30%. Up tilt can also combo into Rest on its own or after a landing down aerial, which can be used to rack up at least 30% and potentially KO as well (especially on platforms), but the confirm has a tight percent window, as well as a sour spot that must be accounted for. Lastly, down air has two main Rest confirms: Drill Rest and Rising Dair Rest. Drill Rest involves using down air and landing on the ground before the final hit connects, buffering a rest so that the confirm lands as soon as possible. This confirm is strong against certain characters such as Kirby, Meta Knight, Mewtwo, Pichu, and opposing Jigglypuff, but aside from them and a select few other characters, it is very inconsistent and often not worth going for. Rising Dair Rest, on the other hand, is performed by rising with down air and buffering a jump rest. This is much more consistent overall against the entire cast, but like up tilt Rest, it has a tight percent window that varies from character to character.

Other methods of safely using Rest involve crouching, buffering, a footstool jump, a jab reset, or interrupting an opposing neutral attack, though few characters are vulnerable to these methods, and they usually require impeccable timing. Platforms can be a saving grace when considering Rest, as they can lead into 0% KO confirms on certain characters and, if they are moving, can make it a bit harder to punish. For all its potential, however, Rest infamously possesses extremely high ending lag, making it very easy to punish if whiffed, though Jigglypuff can skip some of the move's ending lag if it is successfully landed.","To balance out all of these strengths, Jigglypuff is held back by numerous weaknesses. The most detrimental is its survivability: Jigglypuff's stats result in it possessing among the worst endurance out of any character in the game. As a result, it can be knocked out as early as 30% with a sufficiently strong attack. Rage is an additional burden, since opponents can send it flying even earlier with it while Jigglypuff potentially cannot survive long enough to fully reap the benefits of rage itself. These drawbacks force Jigglypuff to play extremely cautiously, as any damage taken can prove dangerous in the long run. Adding insult to injury, Jigglypuff's shield jump launches it upward with enough force to KO it even in the largest of stages, although this weakness rarely comes into effect in competitive play, where shield breaks are uncommon.

Furthermore, Jigglypuff has a very problematic ground game. Although most of its ground moveset is quick in proportion to their power, its lack of range and slow grounded mobility prevent it from racking up large amounts of damage with the majority of said moves. This is worsened when considering the utility of its grounded attacks, which as mentioned are quite high for such an air-heavy character. The only exception is its up smash, a very barebones move that only barely accomplishes its job of being a consistent anti-air that kills at reasonable percents. Its grab game also has similar issues: while Jigglypuff has some of the fastest grabs in the game, landing a grab can sometimes be difficult due to their short range. Its throws are also a mixed bag; whilst the previously mentioned down throw and forward throw are very effective, back throw is similar to up smash in that it is a very one-dimensional move that is barely serviceable enough at its job to be worth using, only instead it's a positioning tool instead of an anti-air. Jigglypuff's up throw is even worse; despite being its strongest KO throw, it is not able to KO reliably even well beyond 200%, and it has very little utility outside of this role. This results in Jigglypuff being easily kept at bay by shields without the usage of Pound's high shield damage and mix-ups with its grab.

Jigglypuff's approach, despite being good in the air, is somewhat predictable. Most of the time, Jigglypuff is forced to remain close to the opponent, read their option in order to approach, or bait them in order to make a move. Its aerial moves are not good for approaching from a long distance as they are unsafe on shield when late, and its dash attack is terrible at doing so due to its high endlag and ineffective sourspot. Coupled with the overall short range on its attacks, it has notoriously difficult matchups against characters with large disjoints like Ike, Lucina, and Shulk. Its polarizing mobility is also a noticeable flaw. Although it has among the best aerial games in Ultimate, its grounded mobility is among the worst, as it does not efficiently give Jigglypuff the chance to traverse across the ground quickly like most other lightweight characters can, and in turn with their floatiness makes Jigglypuff relatively slow. This is especially a problem against speed demons such as Fox and Sonic, who can more easily force Jigglypuff to approach them than vice versa. Lastly, due to its reliance on taking stocks with an edgeguard or a Rest setup, it can sometimes struggle to take stocks without committing to one strong attack, especially against heavier characters with great recoveries such Terry and Yoshi.","Overall, Jigglypuff is an air-based glass cannon that can quickly rack up damage or KO opponents, but in return can be KOed just as quickly."
Lucas,9,4.773,"Lucas is ranked 61st out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the top of the C- tier. This is a sizable drop from his 28th/29th out of 54 placement in Smash 4, where he was tied with Ness.","Being a pseudo-clone of Ness, Lucas shares attributes with him in terms of special moves. However, the two are very different from each other in gameplay. Lucas is a middleweight that has slow walking speed, average dashing speed and gravity, fast air speed, and below-average falling speed. He makes up for his lack of ground mobility with the speed of his attacks, with many possessing low lag, allowing him to rack up damage quickly and safely, while he also boasts a large number of high-damaging and powerful attacks that can KO at early percents.","Arguably Lucas's greatest strength is his extremely dangerous edgeguarding game, which is among the greatest in Ultimate, and allows him to easily KO off-stage opponents at unusually early percentages. PK Freeze freezes opponents and now launches opponents horizontally with powerful knockback, enabling it to KO off-stage opponents at ludicrously low % and making it one of his most infamous edge-guarding techniques. Its incredibly large hitbox makes it an excellent 2-frame punish tool, can be used to punish rolls or techs, and can also be used as a deadly stage spike and ledgetrapping option. PK Fire can be used to snipe offstage opponents for a KO. The orb of PK-Thunder has very high base knockback and hitstun making it extremely useful for dragging the opponent to the blastline, stage spiking them, and sending off-stage opponents far enough from the stage to completely prevent them from recovering. PK Thunder is especially effective against characters with poor horizontal recoveries, who rely on tether recoveries or characters who recover from below, and Lucas can nearly effortlessly gimp them at awkwardly early percents (as low as 0%), while he remains almost completely safely on-stage. PSI Magnet contains a windbox at the start-up of the move that will pull opponents closer to Lucas, in the air, the strength of the windbox scales based on the opponents percentage, which can be useful for setting up an edge-guard situation or even outright gimping opponents. The move's semi-spike hitbox can KO off-stage opponents at reasonable percentages or put them in a bad position off-stage. Alongside his special moves, Lucas has some of the strongest smash attacks that are also excellent at edgeguarding and KOing, especially his down smash; the first hit is among the most powerful in the game and can KO under 60% at the ledge. Similarily to PK Freeze, it has an extremely large hitbox and a long duration that make it an incredibly deadly tool for 2-frame punishes, and ledgetrapping, while it can successfully catch opponents under certain stages and punish rolling or teching opponents. Also, a reverse down smash can potentially stage spike opponents at the edge, and all 3 hits can even sometimes land if the opponents don't tech the individual hits successfully. Lucas's forward smash is a strong and quick smash attack that can efficiently KO opponents who recklessly air dodge towards the stage. Lucas's up smash is among the absolute strongest and has invincibility on frames 1-7, which allows it to punish ledge attacks with proper timing (although it is situational), and can catch some characters hanging on the edge (although it doesn't work on about half of the cast). Lucas's back and forward throws are strong (with the former being among the strongest) and can force edgeguarding situations and KO at high percentages at the ledge. Lucas also possesses two meteor smash aerials, his back and down aerials, while his forward aerial deals strong knockback and is a reliable KOing option. Overall, Lucas has one of the best 2-frame punish abilities in Ultimate, with his PK Freeze, down smash, forward tilt, dash attack, and down tilt being very efficient (especially the former three), while forward tilt and dash attack are surprisingly powerful for attacks of their type.

Alongside his great edgeguarding potential, Lucas' recovery is among the longest and most flexible in the game, thanks to his Zair tether recovery, his long directional air dodge, and his long-distanced PK Thunder 2. His PK Thunder travels in a tighter arc than Ness' and doesn't disappear when hitting an enemy, unlike the latter, while his PK Thunder 2 sends him a much greater distance, allowing him to safely go far off to the sides or far below the stage to edge-guard his opponents and quickly recover on-stage after efficiently edgeguarding or gimping them. Additionally, if he bumps into part of the stage or a wall, he can use his PK Thunder a second time for a limited time, making his recovery even longer overall. However, it can still be exploited by some characters, as it is rather slow overall and his PK Thunder can be absorbed or reflected by some characters, while projectiles can disrupt it efficiently. His PK Thunder 2 also can occasionally have some angling issues, and has long ending lag, making Lucas vulnerable to gimps and punishes by some characters.

Another one of Lucas's greatest strengths lies in his excellent comboing capabilities. Thanks to his ability to loop his moves into each other fairly easily, Lucas's combo game is incredibly dangerous and can be heavily mixed-up. At low to mid percents, neutral air combos into itself, which was mostly popularized by Remi, and all of his aerials, being one of his best combo starters. His forward air also has the ability to chain into itself at low percents. Because Lucas can cancel his jump by using an technique called ""double jump cancel zair"", the tether grab can combo into itself across the entire stage and can lead to potentially unavoidable and heavily damaging combos, as well as dangerous edgeguarding situations. Up air can also combo into itself multiple times; when utilized alongside platforms for assistance, it can potentially rack up to 70%. Down tilt is fast enough to be able to loop into itself, jab, forward tilt, forward air, a grab or even forward smash, especially against fast-fallers like Fox or Greninja and large characters like Bowser. Because of changes in the engine from SSB4 to Ultimate, grounded spikes cannot be teched. This gives Lucas the ability to loop down air into itself and finish the opponents off with forward smash, down smash, forward air, or another off-stage down air if used close enough to the edge. Lastly, aerial spikes aren't techable if they reach a certain knockback this causes back aerial to loop into itself and his other aerials as well at around 60%, and can even lead to an off-stage meteor smash KO when used close enough to the ledge, even though this is more niche and harder to pull off as all the other loops. To compliment his great combo potential, Lucas has many reliable combo finishers; most notably, his powerful and quick forward smash, as well as his exceedingly powerful down smash, are extremely useful for ending jab lock combos as well as down aerial loops.

Lucas also possesses some strong ground moves, primarily down tilt and forward tilt are worth noticing. Down tilt doesn't have a lot of range but it makes up for it by being just as fast as R.O.B.'s down tilt and only being 1 frame laggier. Combined with the fact that the close hitbox can combo into jab, forward tilt, forward air, and (at high percents or against fast-fallers) a grab, it's definitely a grounded move to respect. Forward tilt is a strong disjointed poking tool that when angled up can anti air a plethora of moves. It can also easily 2-frame recoveries when angled down. It's also extremely safe on shield and can only be punished by Link's Spin Attack from out of shield. Up tilt is also used to pop opponents out of the air similar to forward tilt but can combo into up air if they are around 30%. Tap jump is advised in order to do so as that's the only way to bypass the short hop macro. Jab is a useful ""get off me"" and combo tool, but overall outclassed by down tilt's frame data and utility. Dash attack comes out fairly slow, and slows Lucas' ground speed while executing it. However, its hitbox is pretty large and can 2-frame or hit an opponent on the edge. Unlike most dash attacks, it can function as a reasonably strong KO option, as its sweetspot is strong enough to KO Mario at 105% at the edge. In comparison, its sourspot is much weaker, yet dash attack's decent interruptbility and its sourspot's higher launching angle make it serviceable for setting up aerial pressure. While his forward smash is not nearly as strong as his other smash attacks in terms of range and knockback, it makes up for it by being his fastest smash attack, while still being powerful; this move also has the ability to reflect projectiles and is a great combo finisher. Lastly, forward smash also has a tipper hitbox that KOs a lot earlier. Down smash has Lucas strike the ground three times in front of him; each hit getting progressively larger, but also getting progressively weaker (with the first hit of the move being one of the strongest down smashes in the game). The move is incredibly useful for ending jab lock combos, ledgetrapping and 2-frame punishes. It also has a large hitbox that enables it to catch opponents directly below certain stages, thus being one of his best KOing moves. His up smash has invincibility on frame 1-7 (also avoiding grabs) which therefore allows it to be used as a situational counter-attack tool. It also has extremely high knockback that can KO reliably at low percentages. However, the start-up and recovery is extremely high thus making it a ""high risk, high reward"" read and punish option. Alongside his forward and back throws, his up throw is also among the strongest and can KO reliably at high percentages.

Outside of edgeguarding, Lucas has very versatile special moves, PK Freeze has great maneuverability and can be a useful pressuring and anti-air attack. PK Fire sends a fiery bolt straight forward which explodes on contact. It doesn't explode on shields however. It's a decent spacing tool that deals moderate knockback and can sometimes be used as a combo extender. PK Thunder does not disappear upon hitting an opponent like Ness's but instead the tail hits multiple times. This, coupled with its very high hitstun, makes it possible to combo into itself and is a great damage-racking and shield poking tool. It does disappear when it collides with a hard platform or wall. It also disappears when an opponent hits Lucas while he is doing the attack. PK Thunder 2, while lacking the early KO potential of Ness's, deals an extreme amount of damage and is also strong enough to KO at the top blast line at reasonably low percents. PSI Magnet absorbs energy based projectiles. The amount of damage it heals depends on the projectile's power as it heals 1.66x more as the projectile capping at 30%. This makes the move useful for improving Lucas' survivability and to discourage projectile camping from characters with energy projectiles. If projectiles are absorbed while grounded, the end lag after the absorption can be cancelled on the same frame as the absorption with a jump, dodge, or spot dodge, improving the move's safety on the ground. The move also has a semi-spike hitbox upon releasing the special button. Said hitbox is also one of the safest non projectile moves on shield in the game (being +0 on block), and can lead into some combos at low percentages (PSI Magnet into dash attack or grab aerial being some examples). Finally, Lucas has strong wavebouncing abilities, as each of his special moves (except for PK Thunder) gives him a significant recoil which can be very useful for mindgames.","However, Lucas is not without his drawbacks. While he has a powerful pressuring game and can force opponents in a disadvantage state fairly easily, Lucas, himself, has almost non-existent anti-pressuring options, thus, his biggest flaw is his horrible defensive game. Because grabs out of shield have an additional 4 frames of start-up in Ultimate and Lucas lacks a fast grab, up special and up smash, while none of his aerials hit before frame 7, his out of shield game is among the worst in the cast. Additionally, because his overall grounded mobility is average at best, and some of his attacks have rather short range, Lucas primarily struggles with rushdowns, as he can find it difficult to keep out the opponent with forward air and forward tilt, especially if the opponent has superior range and priority than Lucas. He also struggles when put high above his opponents, as he doesn't have a good hitbox under him to force landings and being floaty makes him extremely susceptible to getting juggled, while Lucas is nearly incapable of escaping juggles against characters with great juggling abilities (such as Mario) due to him lacking a useful combo-breaking move. As such, Lucas overall has a terrible disadvantage state and one single mistake can potentially cause him the loss of a stock rather quickly.

Outside of his lack of defensive options, despite Lucas having a solid neutral game thanks to his strong zoning options in his PK Fire, his forward aerial and his Zair, he is otherwise over-reliant on those aforementioned moves to force approaches, which leads to his approach becoming predictable and leaving him with few reliable options, especially against fast characters and characters with even longer and more disjointed attacks, as most of his other attacks suffer from relatively short range despite being disjointed, which can result in him getting overwhelmed by many of those characters and forcing him to rely on his overused zoning options and his underwhelming out of shield options. Also, Lucas notably struggles against characters without energy-based projectiles (most notably Link), as he cannot make use of his PSI Magnet to heal himself against them, and although he has a reflector in his forward smash, it cannot be used in the air, severely hindering his neutral game, while Lucas is virtually unable to successfully approach without getting hit by a single projectile, while his own PK Fire is too laggy and short-ranged to be useful in camping in those matchups, preventing him of winning any projectile wars against characters without energy-based projectiles.

Despite his powerful throws, Lucas's grab game has its issues. Despite having decent range, his grab is slow and is easily punishable, while his throws have little utility outside of edgeguarding and KOing. His down throw, in particular, which has been severely nerfed from SSB4, is completely unreliable at setting up follow-ups above low percentages, while it is by far his weakest throw and cannot KO reliably at realistic percentages. Additionally, his DJCZ, while extremely dangerous when mastered, requires perfect timing as to correctly chain it. As such, Lucas' combo game, while extremely deadly, is very hard to master and thus requires good reads and additional high execution in order to get high damage started, and gives him a relatively high learning curve.","In the end, Lucas is gifted with an extremely versatile moveset, with one of the best edgeguarding games in the game, some of the most powerful smash attacks and throws, a long and flexible recovery and great comboing and pressuring tools, Lucas has an excellent advantage state and can rack up damage very easily with his highly-damaging combo strings or with his high-damaging and powerful moves, while he usually does not have much trouble KOing opponents at early percents either with edgeguarding or with his powerful smash attacks. Lucas fits best into the mix-up type. He has useful zoning options and he can be effective when controlling foes' space and options thanks to his PK Fire, quick disjointed normals, and Rope Snake. However, he can be a formidable foe at close-ranged combat thanks to his amazing comboing and KOing ability, along with his great aerial game. Lucas players must take advantage of his deadly edgeguarding tools by forcing his opponent off-stage with his powerful throws, with many of his aerials, his smash attacks and his special moves being powerful enough to gimp or KO his opponent at exceedingly early percents. However, they must be careful in approaching because his zoning options can quickly become predictable, and he can quickly become overwhelmed by his opponents if he is not careful enough, as his decidely average mobility and underwhelming defensive game can easily be exploited due to his almost non-existent out of shield options, while his floatiness and lack of a reliable hitbox under him can make him very vulnerable to juggles. As a result of this, Lucas is especially vulnerable against characters with superior mobility and longer disjointed range (such as Shulk or Zero Suit Samus), superior zoning abilities (most notably Link) or great recoveries that are difficult to edgeguard (such as Peach), and has an extremely high learning curve."
Banjo & Kazooie ,9,4.674,"Banjo & Kazooie are ranked 62nd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing them in the C- tier and making them the lowest ranking characters from Fighters Pass Vol. 1. The duo have a strong projectile mixup game: their numerous projectiles such as Egg Firing / Breegull Blaster and Rear Egg grant the duo some effective setups and followup potential, with the ability to constantly knock opponents around and lead into combos if used properly. Egg Firing generates long-duration eggs that can disrupt approaches or gimp recoveries, Breegull Blaster can set up aerial combos and platform tech chases, while Rear Egg functions as the duo's main zoning and combo tool, with the niche ability to break out of combos or extend the duo's recovery. The duo's signature move Wonderwing is a long-duration dash with invincibility that is very powerful, has potential to be combo'd into, and can beat out almost every option other than grabs, giving them a safe recovery option and a powerful (albeit committal) reversal in disadvantage. Most of the duo's attacks feature disjointed hitboxes due to Kazooie, giving them some adequate range for close quarters. Their normal moveset has some effective attacks: down tilt functions as an amazing 2 frame punish and edgeguarding option thanks to its long duration and range, up tilt is a powerful anti-air and KO move with low enough endlag to combo into itself at low percents, and forward air is a viable KO tool with good reach. Finally, their status as a heavyweight, along with their two midair jumps, lack of helplessness from Shock Spring Jump and ability to extend their recovery with Rear Egg, gives the duo higher-than-average survivability, and Kazooie's dash speed grants the duo surprisingly fast long-distance movement. Overall, the pair has some solid strengths to control the flow of the game.

However, Banjo and Kazooie have some noticeable flaws. Their moveset suffers from being quite inconsistent due to problematic hitboxes, weak damage and knockback, or both, which can make general combat quite unwieldy. In addition, their frame data is generally unimpressive, with their landing lag also being rather high, which gives them limited attacks that can be thrown out in neutral. Their most intricate combos usually require a lot of technical skill, with effective usage of Rear Egg and Breegull Blaster combos being quite difficult to perform; while some can lead into Wonderwing punishes, most of these combos do extremely low damage. Finally, their damage output is relatively low, and when combined with the aforementioned problems gives them very few consistent followups or good reward for landing attacks, while also giving them few safe KO options. Combined, this means their gameplan is usually limited to winning neutral exchanges using their projectiles to get opponents to make mistakes. Their other problems include their weight, which makes them combo food for a lot of the cast, and their general movement, which is unimpressive outside of Kazooie's dash due to Banjo's slow walk speed, low traction, and poor air speed/jump height. Wonderwing is incredibly risky despite its perks, is designed to be out-prioritized by grabs, is limited to up to five feathers per stock, and is slow enough to be reacted to. Finally, the duo's grab game is passable: their grab is only average, and their pivot grab has the odd quirk of having lower range on aerial foes due to a coding error, while only back throw has the ability to directly KO, and down throw is very inconsistent despite burying opponents, which is unusual for a throw of its type (such as similar throws shared by King K. Rool and Snake).

Overall, Banjo and Kazooie function as an unusual mix of a heavyweight and a zoner: most of their gameplan revolves around picking openings granted by their projectiles, although their general inconsistencies tend to make them considered relatively weak for their archetype. Although Banjo and Kazooie saw minimal representation for the first few years of Ultimate’s lifespan, it has since improved thanks to the efforts of dedicated mains, especially Toriguri.","Banjo & Kazooie, like Duck Hunt, are a tag team that fight together as if they were a singular character. Together, they are a heavyweight and are tied with Snake and R.O.B. as the 18th-heaviest fighters in the game. As Banjo is responsible for the duo's walking, the duo's walking speed is below-average, and their initial dash and traction values are among the worst in the game. Conversely, Kazooie handles the duo's dashing, in which she uses the Talon Trot to carry Banjo. In stark contrast to Banjo's walking speed, Kazooie's dashing speed is very fast; specifically, it is the 12th-fastest in the game, and is only surpassed by Charizard among heavyweights.","With Kazooie hidden in his backpack when the duo are not attacking or dashing, Banjo has a relatively average height and a somewhat wide hurtbox, being rather short as far as heavyweights go. Kazooie, however, lacks a hurtbox of any kind outside of dashing and the duo's up tilt. This means that all standard attacks involving her, other than up tilt, are disjointed. Similar to Charizard and Ridley, Kazooie's Feathery Flap grants the duo a second double jump. Additionally, the duo has a fast falling speed, high gravity, slow air speed, and average air acceleration.

The majority of Banjo & Kazooie's grounded arsenal makes use of moves from their first two games, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie. The duo have a chooseable neutral attack: their standard neutral attack is a 3-hit combo that consists of Banjo using his Claw Swipe twice and then throwing an uppercut, whereas their neutral infinite consists of Kazooie's Rat-a-Tat Rap. It should be noted that the hitbox of Kazooie's neutral infinite is large enough to sometimes hit opponents standing directly behind the duo. This can cause the opponent to be continually jabbed into the duo's rear, keeping them locked in the hitbox and causing both of the fighters to be slowly moved backwards, often amounting to extremely high percentages by the time they reach the edge of a platform. This is somewhat niche, however.

Their forward tilt, Beak Bayonet, involves Banjo quickly thrusting Kazooie as a makeshift bayonet. Like Ridley's forward tilt, it can be angled and has a respectable amount of disjointed range, especially for its speed, making it useful for stopping predictable or vulnerable approaches. Their up tilt consists of Kazooie quickly propping Banjo upward in order for him to perform a stretch kick. Unlike most up tilts, it is strong enough to KO reliably, especially when it is used as a follow-up from their down throw. Despite its respectable power, its low base knockback and fairly low ending lag grant it minor combo potential at very low percentages. However, it has limited horizontal range in front of or behind them, though it can still potentially hit grounded opponents. Their down tilt, Beak Barge, involves Kazooie thrusting her beak forward as Banjo slides belly-first along the ground. It launches at a very low semi-spike angle, making it a very potent edgeguarding and tech-chasing option (as well as a useful option for 2 frame punishes), although it is laggy overall (being the duo's slowest tilt startup-wise) and has a meager damage output. Their dash attack, Banjo's Forward Roll, looks and functions very similarly to Donkey Kong's dash attack, but differs from his by having a noticeably stronger clean hit (which can function as a situational KO option), fewer active frames, and higher ending lag. It has some combo potential (especially from the late hit) and can be used as an approaching attack, but it is not as potent as Donkey Kong's.

Complementing their versatile tilts, Banjo & Kazooie sport very useful smash attacks. Their forward smash, the Breegull Bash, involves Banjo swinging Kazooie as a makeshift bludgeon. It is a relatively slow, yet long-ranged and powerful move that serves as a notable example of Kazooie's disjointed nature. The duo's up smash is the Bill Drill, a spinning attack with Kazooie's beak that is fairly useful as an anti-air attack and out-of-shield option, and is a reliable follow-up from the duo's burying down throw; it has the fastest startup of Banjo & Kazooie's smash attacks, but has minimal horizontal range outside of its initial scoop hitbox, and high ending lag. Their down smash is an original move, a wing-slam from Kazooie (accompanied by a simultanous floor punch from Banjo) covering both sides of the duo much like Ridley, albeit weaker and much faster, making it a useful tool for catching rolls. Notably, their forward and down smashes, especially the latter, have long-lasting hitboxes that slightly penetrate the stage downward, making them both deadly 2-framing tools at the ledge.

Banjo & Kazooie's aerial moveset also combines old and new moves. The duo's neutral aerial is the Twirling Wing Whack, a multi-hitting circular wing spin from Kazooie that functions very similarly to Pit's neutral aerial, albeit with slower startup. It can be used for dragdown combos, though such combos can be inconsistent due to the looping hits' launching angles and the move's high landing lag. Neutral aerial is also useful for edgeguarding off-stage opponents and air-to-airing airborne ones, in part due to the final hit always launching opponents forward. Their forward aerial is performed by Banjo, being a slow but powerful overhand punch, akin to Dr. Mario and Ganondorf's forward aerials. Its clean hit is strong enough to KO reliably while near the edge, and the move is almost always a guaranteed KO while offstage. Despite its power, forward aerial surprisingly has the lowest landing lag of the duo's aerial attacks, and can auto-cancel in a short hop. It can be used to start combos at low percentages, cover the duo's approach, pressure shields, and edgeguard quite safely.

Kazooie's Rat-a-Tat Rap is used as their back aerial; unlike the neutral infinite version, this version hits three times, much like Yoshi and Mega Man's back aerials. This move has respectable power, and is a useful out-of-shield option as well as a reliable (albeit somewhat unsafe due to its lag) KO option offstage. Banjo & Kazooie's up aerial consists of Kazooie flapping her wings together in a scissoring motion, akin to Sonic's up aerial. It has decent disjoint above the duo, and its minimal startup and ending lag enable it to potentially combo into itself at medium percentages. With proper timing, it is possible to use up aerial initiate combos very soon after the duo lands on the ground. However, up aerial's minor damage output and knockback make it lackluster for juggling and almost unusable for KOing. Beak Buster makes an appearance as their down aerial; it is a stall-then-fall attack that meteor smashes opponents during its initial frames, and has a fairly large hitbox upon impacting the stage.

Banjo & Kazooie's special moves are fairly versatile as well. Their neutral special is Egg Firing / Breegull Blaster. Egg Firing, activated when the special button is tapped, sends blue eggs out of Kazooie's mouth that are affected by gravity in a similar manner to Mario's Fireball, and can be used to approach, zone, camp, combo, ledgetrap or edgeguard opponents; the move also briefly stalls the duo's aerial momentum when used in the air. Holding the special button, however causes the move to transition into Breegull Blaster, in which Banjo wields Kazooie like a gun as in Banjo-Tooie's first-person shooter segments, with low damage but faster and constant projectiles, all while being able to move and jump freely in a similar manner to carrying the completed Daybreak parts. While the long-range egg hitboxes of Breegull Blaster have weak knockback and are less useful (unlike the long-range hitboxes of Egg Firing), the close-range egg hitboxes on the other hand are actually the most useful part of Breegull Blaster; close-range Breegull Blaster egg shots can combo into additional close-range egg shots for potent ladder combos, and a single close-range egg shot can be comboed into up tilt at high percentages for a guaranteed KO confirm. Breegull Blaster also has two difficult-to-perform albeit highly potent advanced techniques (smash turnaround cancel and landing turnaround cancel; also known as Kazooie Fast Canceling or KFC) that can bypass the ending lag from canceling the move and even allow it to be comboed into forward smash or Wonderwing. However, because Breegull Blaster is a ""mode"" that takes a moment to be entered and exited, it is sometimes occasionally difficult to use the move in close proximity.

Banjo & Kazooie's side special is Wonderwing, which involves Banjo charging forward while Kazooie shields him with her magic-infused wings. It does high damage and knockback if it connects within the first half of the distance it covers, and its full-body invincibility that lasts through the entirety of the hitbox's duration allows it to out-prioritize nearly every other move in the game (with the exception of most grabs and hit grabs), as well as all counterattacks (aside from Mii Brawler's Counter Throw and Sora's aptly-named Counterattack). Wonderwing's duration and the size of its hitbox also allows it to act as a fantastic 2-framing option on the edge in a handful of matchups (mainly Chrom, Ike and Pichu), as the duo will run in place at the edge for some time. Wonderwing can also be an easy and effective way to brute force a predictable opponent out of projectile camping, though this may backfire if the opponent is baiting the move or otherwise ready for it. It also functions as an excellent recovery option with its horizontal speed, distance and invincibility, and it does not induce helplessness either. However, the move runs on a limited stock of five golden feathers that are not replenished until Banjo & Kazooie are KOed, so its usage must be carefully considered; additionally, despite crossing up shields, Wonderwing's high ending lag and long-lasting singular hitbox can make it fairly unsafe in any case where the opponent can see it coming.

Shock Spring Jump functions as Banjo & Kazooie's up special. It is a decent vertical recovery move that does not render them helpless and preserves their double jumps; it can be charged to increase its travel distance, and when used in the air, the Shock Spring Pad itself possesses a damaging hitbox that can be used to gimp some recoveries. Shock Spring Jump can also be used on-stage to jump higher than Banjo & Kazooie's full hop height, allowing it to come in handy when anti-airing opponents above the duo or when retreating from foes underneath. Rear Egg, their down special, has Kazooie lay an explosive Grenade Egg behind the duo. It bounces in an unpredictable fashion due to its shape and launches opponents upward. Grenade Eggs are also completely unaffected by stale-move negation unlike the rest of Banjo & Kazooie's moveset, further adding to Rear Egg's utility. Additionally, the Grenade Egg also functions as an item; it is catchable and throwable, despite its much shorter fuse compared to similar explosive-related attacks. All of these properties make Rear Egg an incredibly versatile projectile that can be used for zoning, approaching, ledgetrapping, comboing, camping, and neutral game control in general. Overall, their four specials have impressive utility with both physical and projectile options.

Banjo & Kazooie have a somewhat decent albeit imperfect grab game. Banjo's grab range is fairly decent, though oddly enough, his pivot grab has less range against airborne opponents. Forward throw has Kazooie kick the opponent forward with her feet; it can create space between Banjo & Kazooie and their opponent on-stage, though its utility is held back by its awkward launch angle and relatively low base knockback, especially compared to, for example, Jigglypuff's forward throw. Up throw sees Banjo toss the opponent upward, followed by Kazooie pecking at them; it can put opponents above Banjo & Kazooie and setup juggles, but has too much base knockback and too much ending lag to actually have any true follow-ups against most characters. Down throw looks and functions very similarly to King K. Rool's down throw, being a move where Banjo lifts the opponent upward with both of his hands and slams them downward to bury them; at high enough percentages, down throw has a guaranteed 50/50 setup into either up tilt or up smash in most matchups, with the former catching opponents who mash out and the latter catching ones who do not. Finally, back throw is the duo's KO throw, and closely resembles Mario's back throw; it has a collateral hitbox much like Mario's that gives it utility against bystanders (as well as the Ice Climbers and Rosalina & Luma), and it is incredibly powerful, being even stronger than Mario's back throw.","However, the duo has numerous other considerable weaknesses to balance their strengths. Outside of their dash attack, up tilt, smash attacks, forward aerial, back aerial, down throw, back throw, close-range Breegull Blaster and Wonderwing, Banjo & Kazooie's potential to KO can be somewhat limited despite their status as a heavyweight fighter. Many of their moves are unremarkable among their weight class in terms of power, and unlike other fighters with poor KOing abilities, Banjo & Kazooie have a fairly limited combo game. The duo's range is also unremarkable, despite Kazooie's lack of a hurtbox, which means that they will sometimes have issues trading blows with conventional swordfighters. Additionally, some of Banjo & Kazooie's aerial attacks have unusually high landing lag for how weak they are, with neutral aerial having 16 frames, up aerial having 12 frames, and back aerial having 18 frames. Similarly to Wario, Banjo himself has a wide hurtbox, and the duo is susceptible to combos and juggles due to their heavy weight, slow air speed, low jump height, and lack of fast escape options. Their overall mobility is unorthodox; their excellent run speed is offset by their poor initial dash speed, which is tied for the 5th slowest, their high vertical recovery options are hampered by their low jumps, poor air speed, and fast falling speed, and their grounded mobility is hindered by their traction being tied with the Mii Gunner's for the lowest in the game.

Additionally, the duo's special moves, while strong, have significant flaws. Breegull Blaster's long-range egg hitboxes are weak and less useful for zoning than Egg Firing, while Breegull Blaster can be unsafe on shield up close unless the aforementioned difficult-to-perform advanced KFC techniques are performed; also, Breegull Blaster's eggs become weaker with repeated use, discouraging excessive use of the move, though the damage output goes back to normal after a cooldown period if Breegull Blaster is not used. If the duo runs out of golden feathers, they lose access to Wonderwing, eliminating a potent move with plenty of offensive and defensive utility; Wonderwing is also vulnerable to grabs despite its invincibility—although due to its speed, an opponent taking advantage of this is relatively rare—and it is also notoriously unsafe on shield and on whiff, further punishing heavily its misuse. Rear Egg, while being a relatively potent combo tool, can be turned against the duo as opponents can grab it and use it due to its status as an item, as well as the fact that that a previously-laid grenade egg must explode or reach the blast zone before a new one can be laid, meaning the player must wait a while to try again if an egg misses an opponent; additionally, a grenade egg can be Pocketed by Villager or Isabelle, completely ridding Banjo & Kazooie of one of their most useful moves against those two aforementioned characters. Shock Spring Jump requires slight charge time to make their recovery reliable, and it also does not have a hitbox outside of the Shock Spring Pad itself, making it vulnerable to aggressive edgeguarding.","Overall, Banjo & Kazooie are fairly unorthodox characters that can be considered to fall in the heavyweight trapper archetype, similarly to Link, R.O.B. and Snake. As a result, their gameplan is centered on maintaining stage control with the help of their projectiles, yet also being capable melee fighters who have access to a few strong finishers (the most notable of which being Wonderwing). However, Banjo & Kazooie's capabilities fall somewhat short next to comparable characters: Rear Egg is slightly inconsistent at controlling space due to its Grenade Egg's short fuse, Wonderwing is very easy to punish if it is mistimed or read, and the duo's overall frame data and KO power are unimpressive for the heavyweight trapper archetype, limiting their potential to act aggressively. As such, they are quite versatile fighters that can adapt to multiple playstyles even over the course of a single match, though they are more adept at turtling or more methodical playstyles."
Wii Fit Trainer ,9,4.553,"Wii Fit Trainer is ranked 63rd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her in the C- tier. This is a notable improvement from her 50th out of 54 placement in SSB4.","Wii Fit Trainer is a somewhat tall middleweight with a slender physique. She possesses a fast walking speed (the 24th highest), slightly above average dashing speed, a fast initial dash, average air speed, high air acceleration (tied for the 21st highest), high jumps, average gravity, has the 11th highest traction and is tied with Isabelle and the Ice Climbers for the 7th-9th slowest falling speed. In addition, she has one of the longest tech rolls and ledge rolls in the game, which can make her hard to punish even if a roll is expected. These attributes give her overall good mobility, although, comparatively like Luigi and Pit, Wii Fit Trainer is somewhat floaty for her weight class, and is one of the floatiest characters in the game. She can also wall jump and crawl, with the latter being one of the shortest in terms of hurtbox height, making it useful defensively.","Wii Fit Trainer possesses a great damage-racking game through several attacks that deal unusually high damage, most notably her neutral aerial and Header. Additionally, her Deep Breathing makes her faster, stronger, and more durable for a few seconds, further increasing her damage output. Many of Wii Fit Trainer's attacks also have unusual hitbox placements or properties, such as hitting on both sides of her. For example, her forward tilt can hit in front of her with her arm and behind her with her leg; this also applies to forward smash, forward aerial, and the first hit of her neutral attack. The final hit of her neutral attack also has a sweetspot that buries opponents.

Wii Fit Trainer also has two strong projectiles, Sun Salutation and Header. The former can be charged, with the fully charged version dealing high damage, good knockback, and healing her by 2%. The latter is very versatile, with several different common uses. Not only can it combo into many of her attacks, but it can also be used as a long-lasting and large meteor smash, a way to both enter advantage and exit disadvantage, a virtually infinite pool of mixups and setups with Header cancels, and even a recovery tool since it gives Wii Fit Trainer slight upward momentum when used in the air, allowing for stalling and greater horizontal movement.

Wii Fit Trainer also possesses a great air game. With the exception of her back aerial, she can autocancel all of her aerials in a short hop, with neutral aerial and forward aerial even being fast enough to squeeze a back aerial in before landing. Neutral aerial consists of two hits, with the first hit having hitboxes on her arms and legs that lead into the centralized second hit, dealing a total of 14% base damage if both hits connect. This is one of her best combo starters and extenders due to its low lag, low knockback, and 90° launch angle. Because of this, a well placed neutral aerial can easily lead to 70% combos or even extremely early KOs with setups such as neutral aerial's first hit to up smash.

Forward aerial has good power, fast startup, and very little ending lag, with extremely favorable autocancel windows. It also has a hitbox on Wii Fit Trainer's foot which serves as a weak but quick meteor smash, being one of the fastest in the game at frame 9. Back aerial is her fastest aerial in terms of the startup, coming out on frame 5, but is also her strongest, possessing a small sweet spot on her feet on the first active frame that has very high knockback. Up aerial has decent knockback and is good for juggling, with a surprisingly large disjoint that can often beat out opponents landing aggressively. Down aerial is a powerful meteor smash with exceptional hitboxes; the sweetspot covers more than half of the Wii Fit Trainer's body with no initial sour spot. In addition, down aerial has fairly low ending and landing lag, making it relatively safe on shield along with neutral and forward aerial.

Wii Fit Trainer generally fights well in both long-range and close-quarters combat due to her strong projectiles and hard-hitting normals, but struggles at mid-range as a result of her lack of range on her tilts and aerials. As such, the character sometimes has trouble approaching, and typically relies on Header to do so. Wii Fit Trainer has some of the most punishing combos in the game when it comes to damage, but getting close enough to the opponent to start a powerful combo can sometimes prove difficult, especially when the opponent can easily deal with Header, such as Pocket.

Wii Fit Trainer notably excels both offstage and on the ledge. While neither of these areas is where she wants to be necessarily, she has several tools that give her more options than the average character in these scenarios. The most important of these tools is Header, as it can cover Wii Fit Trainer's recovery, as well as stall her in the air or cover ledge options. Due to the character's below-average airspeed and slow fall speed (without Deep Breathing), she can sometimes struggle to land safely. She also possesses three different meteor smashes: Header, down aerial and forward aerial's foot hitbox, which all support Wii Fit Trainer's potent edgeguarding ability.","Wii Fit Trainer's grab game is serviceable, with both forward throw at low percents and especially up throw at mid percents offering some combo potential. Down throw is often used at low percents as well, however, the throw has no true followups on the majority of the cast. Despite several options for combo throws, Wii Fit Trainer lacks a solid KO throw; although back throw is her strongest throw, it typically doesn't KO until well past 140%, and thus requires Deep Breathing to alleviate this flaw.

Wii Fit Trainer's smash attacks are all rather volatile, as they possess high risk for high reward. All three moves are far above average in strength, especially up smash, which is one of the strongest up smashes in the game when connecting the sweet spot at her hands even without Deep Breathing. The move's solid vertical range, quick startup, and 4 frames of full-body intangibility also make it a good anti-air tool. Forward smash is a solid punishing tool since it hits on both sides of Wii Fit Trainer with a large horizontal range, which can also be used to catch landings. The move's main weakness is its notable blind spot directly below Wii Fit Trainer's arms. Down smash is a semi-spike that hits on both sides of Wii Fit Trainer simultaneously, and is her only smash attack that can consistently cover the area close to the ground.

Despite her smash attacks' strengths, these moves also come with the downside of large amounts of ending lag, making them extremely punishable when missed. Although Wii Fit Trainer has several strong attacks, she sometimes has trouble taking stocks, as many of her KO moves are hard to land or are inconsistent, such as forward tilt and back air's poor hitboxes, with the former's large blind spots on both the front and back hits and the latter's sweetspot only lasting for one frame. In addition, forward aerial typically cannot cover the space directly in front of or behind the Wii Fit Trainer. All these inconsistencies add up, leaving Wii Fit Trainer with few truly reliable kills moves, although this weakness was somewhat remedied in update 8.0.0 when both down tilt and Sun Salutation became markedly better at KOing opponents.","Due to her unorthodox moveset, relatively steep learning curve, and lack of the mass appeal that many fighters possess, Wii Fit Trainer has a fairly small playerbase. However, she has received much more attention in Ultimate than in Smash 4, since her overall viability has been greatly improved. It remains to be seen how she will fare in the long run of Ultimate's competitive scene."
Ridley ,9,4.521,"Ridley is ranked 64th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the C- tier","Ridley is a heavyweight character and the tallest fighter in the game, tied for the 13th heaviest character, and possesses the third lowest traction. Ridley has overall good mobility, especially compared to most heavyweights: with two midair jumps, slightly above average walk speed, tied with Charizard for the 10th fastest dashing speed, average air speed, air acceleration and gravity, and the 18th fastest falling speed. Ridley also boasts faster frame data than most heavyweights, further setting him apart from them. Ridley's most defining trait is his potent and varied punish game and aerial pressure. With remarkably long range, high power, and decent speed throughout his moveset, as well as a projectile, Ridley is a serious threat once he gets the advantage; with opponents often overwhelmed and/or find it difficult to get in.","His key strength is his strong air game. Boasting overall quick, powerful, long-ranged aerials, and decent air mobility give Ridley overall excellent air pressure potential. Thanks to his additional jump and relatively high fast fall speed, he has superb vertical flexibility, and can use additional jumps or surprise fastfalls to fake out and punish his opponents with his far-reaching aerials. His neutral aerial is arguably his most effective aerial, having low all-around lag, good range, and average knockback. It is a good combo, spacing, and edge-guarding tool, while also being fast enough to break out opposing pressure if positioned correctly, making it among his most commonly used moves. Forward aerial has the highest damage output of Ridley's aerials when all hits are sweetspotted, but it doesn't have the KO power of his other aerials, though this allows it to perform a wall of pain at low percentages. Back aerial is decently quick and has consistently high damage and knockback, making it a deadly KO move especially if used off-stage for edge-guarding. Up aerial is a decent juggling move with decent startup and good KO potential when sweetspotted, but requires opponents to be very close to or above Ridley to land and the hitboxes don't last long. Lastly, down aerial is a stall-and-fall that powerfully meteor smashes opponents when sweetspotted while still having good KO potential when sourspotted, though he is stuck falling for a while and has a lot of landing lag.

Ridley's grounded game is also noteworthy in terms of utility. His neutral attack is his fastest attack (with a 4 frame startup), leading into either a rapid jab with a finisher or a gentleman jab. His forward tilt has good range and low lag overall, while dealing high knockback if sweetspotted, with the low angled version being a reliable two-framing option. Meanwhile, his up and down tilts offer varied potential, with up tilt being a great anti-air that can chain into itself, most aerials, and even up smash, whereas down tilt allows Ridley to combo off from a safe distance and set up punishes or juggles. His dash attack is one of the few to lack a sourspot and has respectable power, however it is only active for 2 frames and has a lot of ending lag. Forward smash has below-average startup and is short ranged, but good damage and knockback and is fast enough to punish whiffs, landings, or be a more situational follow up like off a late hit of a landing neutral aerial. Down smash has slow start up and less raw power, but is disjointed, covers a very large area, hits both sides simultaneously, and physically moves Ridley upwards, making it very useful to punish rolls and slow ledge attacks or to avoid grabs and low-to-the-ground attacks. It is also a notoriously effective punishment option after a successful Skewer sweetspot as it can cover most get-up options. Up smash is Ridley's fastest and most reliable smash attack, being an effective KO move despite being the weakest of his smash attacks, and serves as a very effective anti-air as Ridley's foot is granted invulnerability.

Ridley's special moveset offers a variety options. Plasma Breath is Ridley's projectile: it fires a small, bouncing ball of fire, and can be charged to fire up to five, dealing substantial damage when fully charged and all fireballs connect. The fireballs can also fall when sent off-stage, making them an effective on-stage edgegaurding or gimping tool. However, landing a hit on Ridley's mouth during the move will cause it to deal damage to himself and stun him for a significant amount of time. Skewer is a ""high risk, high reward"" punishment move that, when sweetspotted, deals extremely high damage and crumples enemies; while situational due to the high difficulty on sweetspotting the move, it puts the opponent in a dangerous position where Ridley can read their reaction. Space Pirate Rush is a command grab with some unique perks: on land, Ridley drags the opponent on the ground, dealing damage in the process; in the air, it causes both Ridley and the opponent to quickly fall similar to Ganondorf's Flame Choke; it can be cancelled into a throw at any time that puts both Ridley and the opponent into the air; it can cancel itself into a throw upon reaching the edge of the platform; and the aerial version will transition into the grounded version if it reaches the ground. The grounded version has decent KO power at high percents, while the airborne version is weaker and is better suited to sending recovering opponents further from the stage without removing Ridley's own recovery options, or be used as a sacrificial KO like the aforementioned Flame Choke. Lastly, Wing Blitz is Ridley's primary recovery move. It can be aimed in four directions, with the forward input traveling at a slight downwards angle, the backward variant traveling at a slight upward one, and the down variant traveling at a slight diagonal angle in front of Ridley. All Wing Blitz variants have a large ledge sweetspot and have high knockback, with the down input having a meteor smash sweetspot; the down input is also unique in that it can be used at the edge of the stage and grab the ledge as long as the down direction is not inputted for longer, which can let Ridley potentially ledge trump an unsuspecting opponent or send them straight down, depending on their position.

Due to the variety of his kit, Ridley is a jack-of-all-trades. His disjoints are effective against characters with poor range or grab-centric playstyles; his command grab is effective against highly defensive characters; and his projectile is effective against characters lacking projectiles themselves or taking out characters with lackluster recoveries. He hangs very low from the ledge, letting him avoid attacks notable for hitting hanging characters, such as Marth and Lucina's forward smash. Despite so many unique attributes, he has several attributes that fight against him.","While Ridley has many strengths, he also has some critical and exploitable weaknesses. The most notable weakness is his size: Ridley has among the largest, most awkward hurtboxes out of the cast which, combined with his heavy weight and fast falling speed, makes him very easy to combo, juggle, and hit in general. This combined with his lower weight compared to similarly sized characters negatively affects his survivability, as he is often at a considerably higher risk of dying. Ridley's frame data, although good for a heavyweight, is still poor. He has below average startup and above average ending lag overall on his toolkit and lacks a tool fast enough to break combos effectively; this makes him one of the most affected characters by average combo strings and he is rather easy to KO. Ridley's options against projectile users and zoning are virtually nonexistent and he is unable to counter-zone as his own projectile is laggy, travels slowly, are useless against more powerful projectiles, and could even backfire and leave him open to punish if an opponent's projectile hits his mouth. Another major weakness his is recovery, which primarily consists of two, long-startup, predictable moves: Space Pirate Rush and Wing Blitz. The latter only has a couple useful angles and has active hitboxes while in motion, making it very easy to land an off-stage counterattack.

Another critical flaw to Ridley is how drastically his moves vary in quality, which can lead to Ridley becoming quite predictable. While he has plenty of moves offering varying amounts of utility, some of them still have significant flaws; these can range from slow startup (Plasma Breath and down smash), absurd blindspots (up tilt and up smash on some occasions), overly situational and/or strict (Skewer), to being downright unreliable (down aerial). On the other side of the spectrum, some of Ridley's moves like neutral aerial, up smash, down tilt, and Plasma Breath, depending on the match-up, is so favorable that it becomes easy to over-centralize on their use, a detriment to a character that finds the most success in being unpredictable. This, combined with his aforementioned trouble at dealing with fast and/or zoning characters, and with recovering under pressure, makes Ridley one of the most susceptible characters to pressure, as Ridley's disadvantage state makes him easy to overwhelm, and failure to overwhelm or control aggression could force him to take heavy damage or even be KOed outright. His grab game is also poor, with down throw serving as both a combo starter at low to mid percents to a KO through at higher percents. Forward and back throw lack reasonable kill power, even with ideal positioning, and up throw, while being his most damaging throw and a passable kill throw with low ceiling stages, sends opponents too high for any true conversions. Despite down throw being one of his better throws, it is easily affected by opponent's directional influence, further limiting his grab options.

Lastly, Ridley's advantage state, unarguably being very oppressive, is greatly held back by his middling airspeed. Despite possessing an additional mid-air jump and impressive aerials, Ridley has a surprisingly difficult time staying airborne. He generally needs to gain some distance while grounded to approach with his aerials, and while his dash speed is very impressive, it's restrictive regardless, and Ridley lacks the number of jumps that characters like King Dedede and Pit have to help circumvent their airspeed issues. Various combos are usually unable to extend in the air for long thanks to this, as his aerials may deal too much knockback to follow up after one or two attacks. This is further shown in his recovery, as Wing Blitz and Space Pirate Rush are usually options he must use to recover, even if Ridley isn't that far from the stage. While Ridley's airspeed is definitely better than most other fellow characters with multiple jumps, it's still merely average compared to the whole cast, which tones down his overall effectiveness in the air, and this is further exacerbated by him being a fast-faller.","Overall, Ridley is a character of extremes with a relatively high learning curve. Similarly to what Mewtwo is among lightweight characters, Ridley fills in the position of being a glass cannon heavyweight. He has excellent damage, pressure, and edge-guarding potential with a broad arsenal of powerful moves and tools to gain and sustain advantage, gradually poke and pressure from a fair distance away, and punish whiffs or what would normally be an inconsequential slip-up. This allows Ridley to easily make comebacks or greatly widen his lead with minimal set up should an opponent make a single error in considering Ridley's approach. However, despite possessing a powerful and highly versatile moveset, Ridley lacks strong options out of disadvantage and generally struggles to oppose pressure from opponents due to his size and the frame data on his aerials and grounded attacks. This makes top tier matchups like Snake and Palutena difficult for Ridley, as they are well-equipped to combat Ridley through oppressive walls of projectiles or strong aerial combos respectively. As such, mix-up heavy playstyles are heavily encouraged when playing Ridley to prevent opponents from capitalising on his own susceptibility as much as possible."
Duck Hunt ,9,4.489,"Duck Hunt are ranked 65th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing them at the end of the C- tier. This is a considerable drop from their 30th out of 54 placement in SSB4.","Duck Hunt are a duo that fight collectively as if they were a single character, much like Banjo & Kazooie. They are lightweights, and specifically weigh as much as Sonic, which places them among the bottom 20 in that category. Duck Hunt also have below-average height, above-average walking/dashing speeds (being the 25th and 36th fastest, respectively), a slow initial dash (tied for the 12th slowest with Incineroar, Snake, Bowser Jr., and Ryu), low traction (the 15th lowest), above-average air speed (tied for the 20th fastest with Bowser, Sheik, Lucas, and Mega Man), average air acceleration and falling speed, and low gravity (the 14th lowest). Duck Hunt can also crawl and wall jump. These traits make Duck Hunt a character who, while lacking strong burst movement on the ground due to their slow dash, does a good job at maintaining aerial presence with their air speed and fairly high jumps. Collectively speaking, their overall mobility is average.","Due to having three unique projectiles for special moves, Duck Hunt excel in zoning and stage control with an emphasis on setups. Trick Shot generates a tin can that explodes on contact, and the fact that it can be maneuvered by the player with a press of the special button makes it a key component of Duck Hunt's pressure, setups, and stage control. Additionally, the fact that the can is generated on frame 1 gives it utility as a combo breaker. Clay Shooting involves throwing a clay pigeon that can be detonated with a press of the special button. It not only has use as a zoning tool, but it also functions as Duck Hunt's most potent combo starter, as the fact that they can act out of the move before it detonates allows them to chain the move into itself, aerials, or a combination of the two. Wild Gunman summons a gunman that shoots from their respective gun after a delay. This further supplements their zoning and setup-centered playstyle, since they can act out of the move before the gunshot. In addition, the gunmen possess their own hurtboxes, giving it occasional use for blocking attacks.

Duck Hunt's air game also has decent utility courtesy of their good air speed. Back aerial is a fast and powerful finisher that comes out at frame 7 and KOs middleweights as early as 120% from the edge of Final Destination, making it even deadlier in the context of edgeguarding. Neutral aerial also compliments their edgeguarding abilities, as it comes out fast at frame 6 and has lingering hitboxes that make it useful for gimps while the strong hit also functions as a passable KO move, KOing middleweights at 135% from the edge of Final Destination. Finally, up air is a good vertical finisher that starts KOing middleweights at around 135% near the blast zone, plus it comes out fast at frame 6 and has a decent amount of active frames.","Unfortunately, Duck Hunt's main weakness is that, outside of some of their aerials, the aspects of their kit that don't revolve around their versatile projectiles are rather lackluster. For example, while their aerials are undeniably the best parts of their kit outside of their special moveset, some aren't without their flaws. Although forward aerial is fairly fast at frame 7 and has decent range, it has atrocious KO power; even with the sweetspot, the move doesn't start KOing middleweights until around 180% from the edge of Final Destination, and the fact that the move has sourspots adds a layer of inconsistency to its already poor KO power. In addition, down aerial has some inconsistencies of its own, as while it is a decent spike on paper, the two hits don't always connect into each other. Duck Hunt's endurance also leaves more to be desired due to their low weight and exploitable recovery; while Duck Jump covers good horizontal and vertical distance, its unremarkable speed and lack of protection make it prone to edge guards. While their recovery fares better than in SSB4 due to it being able to be canceled into attacks and air dodges, the fact that Duck Hunt can only cancel their recovery 50 frames later still makes it fairly exploitable.

However, the flaws of other aspects of Duck Hunt's kit are most apparent in their ground game, as their grounded normals are mediocre at best and well below average at worst. While their rapid jab is a good damage racking option, neither it nor the standard jab start KOing middleweights until 190%. Forward tilt, while being disjointed and having passable startup at frame 8, lacks range in comparison to other disjoints and doesn't start KOing middleweights until 150%. Up tilt, while in theory being a frame 7 combo starter into neutral and up aerial at low and mid percentages, isn't that consistent in practice due to the fact that its narrow hitbox struggles to hit grounded opponents even at point blank range. Even down tilt, which is among their best grounded moves due to being their fastest grounded poke (at frame 6) and being capable of starting tech chases, suffers from being an even worse disjoint than forward tilt in terms of both range and KO power.

While the aforementioned moves are simply mediocre, the same cannot be said for their dash attack, a move that is genuinely below average; it has slow startup at frame 10 while also having abysmal KO power, as it can't even KO middleweights past 200%. On top of having slow startup, Duck Hunt's poor initial dash further hinders its use as a burst option, a role that dash attacks are generally meant to fulfill. Duck Hunt's smash attacks don't do their ground game many favors either, as while they have good KO power and are disjointed for utilizing the NES Zapper, their startup is rather subpar and they have awkward hitboxes that prevent all the hits from connecting at times. Their grab game is also a contributor to their less than stellar strength on the ground; their standing and pivot grabs have deceptively good range, but the reward they get from a grab leaves more to be desired due to none of their throws leading to consistent combos or KOing at reasonable percentages.","Overall, Duck Hunt excel at controlling the neutral by simultaneously controlling both the duo and their assortment of projectiles in order to generate setups, frame traps, and pressure whether the opponent is onstage, at ledge, or offstage while their good air mobility and fair share of fast aerials also give them a slight emphasis on offstage edgeguards. In exchange for these strengths, they have a notable lack of flexibility in other aspects of their kit due to their overall average recovery and ground game, meaning they have to be more reliant on crafty use of their projectiles in order to get things going compared to other zoners.

Essentially, Duck Hunt are solid characters, yet other characters of a similar archetype simply have more flexibility in parts of their kits that don't revolve around their projectiles. For example, while Link is good at zoning and creating setups with Boomerang and Remote Bomb, he is considered to be a better character because he has notable strengths all across the board, such as a strong out of shield option in the form of Spin Attack, safe and potent aerials in the form of his neutral and forward aerials, and an overall better ground game than Duck Hunt due to the greater reach and power of his disjoints, as well as his more combo-friendly grab game. While it is not entirely certain whether Duck Hunt's strengths outweigh their flaws or vice versa, Duck Hunt are generally considered to be viable."
Mewtwo,10,4.354,"Mewtwo is ranked 66th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it at the top of the D+ tier. This is a drastic drop from its 10th out of 54 placement in SSB4, the largest drop for a veteran in the transition from SSB4 to Ultimate. Mewtwo's greatest strengths lie in its offensive capabilities, being able to rack up large amounts of damage via its strong normals and special moves. Most notably, Shadow Ball is a strong and versatile projectile that serves as a centerpiece to Mewtwo's main game plan, allowing it to apply pressure to opponents by being a strong tool for KOing and allowing for combos at its weaker charges courtesy of Mewtwo's high mobility. Additionally, Mewtwo has a multitude of viable KO tools which allows it to secure stocks reliably, such as the aforementioned Shadow Ball, forward aerial, back aerial, its powerful kill throws and smash attacks. Its other specials have their place in Mewtwo's game plan as well - Confusion and Disable allow Mewtwo to set up into KOs, with the former also acting as a reflector, giving it an answer to camping opponents with projectiles. In addition to being a strong tool for recovery especially when paired with Confusion and its double jump, Teleport possesses low lag, allowing it to be used as an escape option should Mewtwo find itself in a bad spot.

Despite these strengths, Mewtwo packs some severe, glaring weaknesses, most notably in its weight and size. Mewtwo is tied for the seventh lightest character in the game and it is prone to losing stocks at low percents. Unlike the other characters in its weight class, Mewtwo is easier to hit and juggle because of how big and floaty it is, making matchups such as Fox and Falco notoriously difficult. Its slow double jump and lack of combo breaker moves, combined with the aforementioned downsides, leads to Mewtwo having a very poor disadvantage state (outside of recovery), made worse by its infamous tail hurtbox, making Mewtwo easier to be clipped by a lot of attacks while also adding extra risk to the usage of tail moves.

Overall, while Mewtwo possesses strong tools and high KO power, as well as a powerful projectile and combo game courtesy of Shadow Ball, it is difficult for it to find consistency due to its undesirable combination of being a very large and lightweight character. As a result, Mewtwo rarely sees representation in competitive play, with tournament results mainly coming from WaDi prior to his leave from competitive play, however Players such as Remrin and SUZUNE, have managed to get solid results with the character.","Mewtwo is a large, tall fighter with a slew of powerful moves, but it is actually a lightweight fighter (tied for 7th lightest in the game with Kirby, Pikachu, Olimar, and Sephiroth). Despite its size, Mewtwo's overall mobility is outstanding: it has above-average traction, the 20th fastest walking speed, the 9th fastest dashing speed, is tied (with Bowser, Marth, Lucina, and Lucario) for the 6th fastest initial dash, and has the 3rd fastest air speed in the game. Mewtwo has a low initial jump, but its short hop is rather high and its double jump is the highest in the game (albeit delayed); additionally, Mewtwo has average air acceleration and falling speed with below-average gravity. Given these attributes, Mewtwo falls squarely into the glass cannon category and must use its uniquely fast mobility to land devastating blows while avoiding close-quarters combat where its size – particularly its notoriously vulnerable tail – and light weight can become a liability.","Mewtwo's overall damage output is very high, especially in regard to its grounded moves. Neutral attack is a fairly disjointed neutral infinite that can regularly rack up 20% or more damage if the opponent is caught at close range, but it is unsafe on shield. Forward tilt is a strong tail swipe with good range and a sweetspot that can KO reliably at high percentages while near the edge, but it has moderate start-up and ending lag. In addition to its deceptively high power, it can also be angled to serve as a niche anti-air or ledge-hanging punish option. Up tilt is an overhead tail swipe with generous range around Mewtwo's entire body and its large but brief sweetspot (located directly in front of Mewtwo) launches opponents up and toward Mewtwo, making it an excellent combo starter in neutral. Down tilt is a low tail sweep boasting relatively low ending lag, quick start-up, and good grounded range while launching opponents at mostly vertical angles. This makes it a great neutral and combo tool, comboing into all of Mewtwo's aerials and up tilt if the opponent is hit at close range. While down tilt is technically unsafe on shield, its overall quick speed and long range make it difficult to punish if an enemy reacts too slowly.

On the contrary, down smash is safe on shield and is notorious for causing immense shield damage if it connects. Nonetheless, it is still a risky move to use in the neutral game, due to it having the most amount of start-up among all of Mewtwo's smash attacks and being one of the few down smashes in the entire game to only hit on one side. In contrast, Up smash has the quickest start-up of all Mewtwo's smash attacks and is a great anti-air to catch forced landings, but also has the highest ending lag and is generally the most punishable move in Mewtwo's moveset. Forward smash has decent range, can be angled and is Mewtwo's most powerful smash attack in terms of knockback when spaced (being able to KO at mid percentages while close to the edge) and can potentially allow it to dodge attacks via shifting its hurtbox, since it leans back just before charging it, but has noticeable ending lag and is also not safe on shield if landed at close range. These traits make Mewtwo one of the strongest characters in the game in terms of outright KO power, though it is optimal for players to not play too close to opponents with quick movement, disjointed range, or attacks that are fast enough to punish any mistakes. However, Mewtwo can also use its great ground and air speed to mix up approaches and punish mistakes using these moves, making it necessary for high-level players to recognize when to approach offensively.

Mewtwo's aerials are some of the best in the game, with generally quick start-up, low landing lag, long range and great power. Forward aerial is a claw swipe that serves as a safe poke when spaced on landing, a useful combo starter at low percentages, and a reliable KO option; it is considered by many to be among the best forward aerials in the game due to its safety, speed, and power. Neutral aerial consists of Mewtwo emitting electricity from its hands and feet for multiple hits, before launching opponents away with a large electricity discharge surrounding its full body. The move is a capable combo starter at all percentages, and is a safe poke when it is spaced sufficiently; it is also Mewtwo's best out-of-shield option due to his aerial speed allowing it to safely escape pressure (compared to committing to its laggy up smash). Though his forward and neutral aerials are fast and threatening, they are only slightly disjointed and the former lacks range. This makes Mewtwo's approach game with these moves significantly weaker against opponents that have long weapons or strong projectiles.

Back aerial is Mewtwo's second slowest aerial, primarily being used to wall out offstage opponents who have poor range and/or recoveries. However, it can be beaten out by disjoints easily, cannot reliably hit close to ground at any height, and leaves Mewtwo's tail very vulnerable if it whiffs. Since it swings its tail upwards, it is also less effective when Mewtwo is falling downwards, and is better used while Mewtwo is rising from its midair jump. As a result, it cannot fulfill the role of giving Mewtwo good effective range in the neutral game. Up aerial is one of Mewtwo’s best moves, as it has decent start up, short end and landing lag, covers a large arc starting directly in front of Mewtwo’s face, and has incredibly strong power. Altogether, these traits make the move relatively safe to use in neutral and excellent for punishing landings or reckless edgeguards. Down aerial has the most startup of Mewtwo's aerials, but is a very strong meteor smash when sweetspotted, has a decently disjointed hitbox directly beneath Mewtwo that can two frame punish, and can also serve as a situational combo starter at low to medium percentages.

Mewtwo's neutral special, Shadow Ball, has excellent versatility, as it can combo into virtually any of Mewtwo's quicker moves at any percent depending on the charge of the projectile. When fully charged, it also becomes a reliable KO move at high percents, and deals decent shield damage for good measure. In midair, it can even be used as a landing mixup, as the recoil from the fully charged variant pushes Mewtwo back a considerable distance. Mewtwo can utilize techs like wavebounces, B-reverses, Shadow Ball cancels and turnaround specials to make its movement even more tricky, improving its baits and punishes. However, it has a decent amount of startup, making it risky to use at close range. Its side special, Confusion, is a command grab with a very large grabbox that doubles as a somewhat slow but very active reflector and can be used for combo setups, though alert opponents can react out of it before Mewtwo below a certain amount of damage.

Mewtwo's down special, Disable, is a risky option in most situations due to its start-up, high ending lag and its requirement that the opponent be within a very short distance away while also facing Mewtwo on the ground for it to work. However, if landed at mid to high percentages, it more often than not leads to a guaranteed stock by allowing Mewtwo to punish the opponent with any option that will KO, such as with Down Smash or a charged, upward-angled Forward Smash. It additionally has intangibility frames before the attack comes out, making it easier to beat out poor grounded approaches with while also ensuring that Mewtwo will not stun the opponent while simultaneously taking a hit, and serving as a very niche defensive option in the air.

Mewtwo also possesses a strong grab game. Its up throw and back throw are both among the strongest in the cast, while forward throw is excellent at racking up damage at low percentages and possibly killing near the ledge at higher percentages. Mewtwo's down throw has respectable combo potential: it can combo into upward angled forward tilt and up tilt (depending on the opponent's DI) at low percentages, and into forward aerial at medium percentages, with the latter also being a reliable KO combo on the majority of the cast at high percentages if they fail to DI properly. Mewtwo's grab range is only slightly above average which can sometimes hurt the utility of its throws in close-quarters combat or out of shield, but its dash grab is relatively quick and has great range due to Mewtwo's very fast dashing speed, making it useful as a surprise burst option.

Due to Mewtwo's varied attributes and special moves, its recovery potential is arguably the best in the game. Its combination of having the 3rd fastest air speed, the highest double jump in the game, low gravity and average falling speed give it great longevity and mobility off-stage. Teleport, its primary recovery move, covers a long distance and provides full intangibility and directional mobility, making it nearly impossible to edgeguard if Mewtwo chooses to teleport to the edge from above. Furthermore, two of its other special moves offer a form of assistance with recovery: a fully charged Shadow Ball's recoil can push Mewtwo back far enough to be a viable horizontal recovery option if aimed away from the stage, and Confusion can turn it around, temporarily stalls it in the air when used once and can be combined with the momentum from a rising double jump when used twice to go even higher. With these options, Mewtwo has many ways to mix up its recovery and get safely back on-stage, while still being able to punish reckless edgeguarders with its powerful and long ranged up and back aerials without losing recovery distance.

Mewtwo has surprisingly good range for a lightweight fighter. All of its smash attacks have disjointed hitboxes that allow them to beat out attacks safely; this is especially evident with up smash, as using it at the right time can prevent any stall-then-falls. Forward smash can be angled up or down to catch an airborne opponent or to edgeguard low recoveries, respectively. Mewtwo's tail attacks also offer excellent range, despite not being as disjointed. Its back aerial in particular offers very large coverage behind Mewtwo and can be used in decently quick succession, making it a useful walling tool against opponents with low range attacks. Its tilts also use its tail, so they have good range as well. Tying into this is its aforementioned mobility; Mewtwo's extremely fast horizontal movement speed grants it a very potent punishment game with its range, allowing it to bait approaches and easily punish them with its long-reaching moves.

To compensate for its large size, Mewtwo is granted with traits and unique defensive options that allow him to escape pressure. Its forward and back rolls have among the longest traveling distances in the game, making them deceptively effective for movement compared to those of other characters of similar size. Its edge attack has among the longest ranges out of the roster, allowing it to punish ledgetrapping attempts. All of its air dodges render it invisible; combined with its fast air speed and moderate air acceleration, Mewtwo can play mind games with its aerial drift while invisible. Offstage, Mewtwo's incredibly long-distanced recovery enables him to use air dodges and safely recover in situations when many other fighters wouldn't. In addition, using a neutral air dodge immediately after using Mewtwo's double jump causes it to immediately gain height while maintaining intangibility and invisibility, making it useful to mix up opponents in the air. Mewtwo's Teleport travels a significant distance and can be used very quickly out of shield (frame 9 intangibility) as a long-ranged evasive maneuver, allowing it to gain more favorable stage positioning and space from aggressive opponents – especially when teleporting off of platforms to avoid pressure. And though it is brief, Disable provides intangibility frames just before Mewtwo emits the light from its eyes, giving it niche defensive use with good timing even in the air where the projectile cannot be clanked with.","Despite Mewtwo's strengths, it has some noticeable weaknesses, the most glaring of which is its infamously poor endurance. Mewtwo's very light weight makes it easy to KO, while its tall frame, average falling speed and below average gravity make it easier to combo compared to other characters of its weight class. Furthermore, Mewtwo lacks an effective aerial move to disrupt combos, and an attempt to Teleport out of a combo can be interrupted due to its startup or punished due to its noticeable ending lag and momentum. And compared to all other characters in the game, Mewtwo is also unable to reliably double jump out of juggling pressure due to it taking a noticeable amount of time for his hurtbox to shift vertically. However, its aerial speed and recovery mix-ups can mitigate some of these shortcomings.

Although Mewtwo has a multitude of KO options, it often has trouble landing them due to it needing to safely approach the enemy. Up and back throw can be risky to attempt because of Mewtwo's aforementioned average grab range. Forward and down smash have slow start-up lag, whereas up smash has minimal horizontal range below its blast of dark energy and high ending lag (it can also unreliably connect due to some jostle animations). Forward aerial and Shadow Ball's KO potentials can be hindered via staleness because of their frequent usage in Mewtwo's combos and neutral game. Lastly, its frame data is slightly below-average, which makes its attacks even more prone to punishment if they are not spaced well and used intentionally. As a result, Mewtwo cannot effectively pressure through offensive means, yet needs to rely on its movement options and special moves to create openings from which it can proceed to punish the opponent. During Mewtwo's disadvantage state, it often cannot depend on its offensive options to relieve pressure, and instead must rely on evading and only attacking when necessary.","Overall, Mewtwo is a non-traditional glass cannon who falls under the category of the zoner archetype; it must play cautiously and aware so the opponent does not capitalize on its large hurtbox and light weight. However, this does not mean Mewtwo is forced to rely on turtling, as its outstanding mobility, excellent air game, and overall powerful moveset make it a force to be reckoned with. Instead, Mewtwo should be played very patiently by controlling space (zoning) as well as baiting and poking with Shadow Ball, its aerials and its movement.

As a result, Mewtwo is a character with a fairly high learning curve, as it has to capitalize on reads more often than not because of its frailty and susceptibility to pressure. While Mewtwo's moveset may not be as versatile as other characters, such as Wolf's, it makes up for it with comparatively huge power and damage output. In short, Mewtwo has the attack power and range of an archetypal heavyweight, yet retains the combo game and mobility of a lightweight.

Mewtwo's competitive potential is up for debate as of now. Some professional players believe that Mewtwo should be ranked as a higher end mid tier character due to its excellent mobility and damage racking game. Conversely, other players consider placing it as a low tier due to its large hurtbox and light weight, as well as its potent neutral game being toned down slightly. Mewtwo itself has a small playerbase, but the players who are dedicated to maining it, such as WaDi, have managed to achieve respectable placements."
Robin ,10,4.206,"Robin is ranked 67th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the D+ tier. This is a noticeable drop from his 37th/38th out of 54 placement in SSB4, where he was tied with Samus.","Robin is a tall, middleweight character who has very low ground mobility. Robin’s dashing speed is the second slowest in the game, and his walking speed is very slow. While his dashing speed is below average, Robin still has an average initial dash distance, which allows Robin users to rely on Fox-trotting as a quicker ground movement option. Outside of these attributes, Robin's other traits are typical of a middleweight; his air speed, traction, falling speed, and gravity are all average. However, Robin's air acceleration is above average. As a result of these attributes, Robin has difficulty chasing foes and fleeing from them at the same time, though his oddly decent aerial mobility compensates this to a degree.","Robin's tomes provide a myriad of spacing, pressuring, and additional damaging capabilities. Both the Thunder and Fire tomes can disrupt opponents, rack up damage, and open up windows to chain attacks together. Thunder and the slightly stronger Elthunder peppers at mid-range or shorter, while Arcthunder travels for longer and has trapping capabilities for pressure, combos and set-ups, and Thoron pierces through opponents and deals considerable knockback. Arcfire produces a trapping, multiple hitting pillar of flame that is instrumental for approaching or disrupting approaches, pressuring, and chaining together attacks. In addition to the Fire tome, Robin's neutral attack involves the Wind tome: the former tome generates a singular explosion of fire magic that deals strong diagonal knockback, while the latter tome generates a neutral infinite consisting of wind magic that deals high damage and concludes with a blast of wind magic that deals strong vertical knockback. Elwind provides respectable vertical recovery and its first hit can be used to punish aerial and post-recovery opponents by spiking them at point-blank with the first hit. Lastly, Nosferatu is a self-healing move which heals Robin, especially if cast from behind and while having a higher damage percentage than his opponent, while it also cannot be shielded due to functioning like a grab. However, it is tricky to use, as the opponent must be at almost point-blank range to land it, although Arcthunder's trapping ability can help Robin land it easier, and it grants full-body intangibility.

Aside from using tomes, Robin's Levin Sword is a potent weapon in its own right. It is a powerful, fairly long-ranged, and electrically-charged sword that functions as a terrific offensive tool due to its excellent pressure capabilities, its impressive combo potential and its high KO power. Robin whips this out for his smash and directional aerial attacks when a smash input is inputted, and for neutral aerial when the Levin Sword is already in use. It can be swung eight times before it breaks. Robin's down smash with the Levin Sword has good ledge trapping potential, as it can hit hanging opponents and the electric shockwaves cover both sides of Robin. Despite being vastly inferior to the Levin Sword in regards to KO potential, the Bronze Sword has combo potential due to its weaker knockback. His neutral aerial covers both front and back sides successively, which can be useful for spacing in the air, and is his most effective out of shield option. His down tilt can keep away grounded opponents in front of him.

Once Robin's tomes are depleted and the Levin Sword is broken, they can act as throwable items that deal immense damage, shieldstun and knockback. Properly managing Robin's discarded weapons is crucial for optimal play, as the opportunities they can potentially grant are significant. Outside of his magic and sword attacks, Robin has two useful throws: back throw is a viable KOing option near the edge that can combo into Thoron to get early K.Os, while down throw is a reliable combo starter.","However, as previously stated, Robin suffers from numerous weaknesses, such as being the second slowest runner in the game. Furthermore, Robin lacks defensive options and has trouble brushing off opponents, especially those who are directly beneath, making Robin susceptible to rush-downs and juggles. Robin’s tilts generally have short range, making it difficult for Robin to fight at mid-range outside of the use of tomes. Many moves, specifically smash attacks and special attacks, have significant ending lag, which leaves Robin wide open for punishment proceeding his execution. His forward smash, though extremely strong, has a very limited range, sometimes completely missing fighters when said fighters crouch, and is also extremely laggy. Down smash is a strong move with a great range, however the range has limited success as the farthest part of the range is also one of the weakest parts. Up smash is a strong move with considerably less endlag compared to his other smash attacks, however it has mediocre range, and even worse range while using the Bronze Sword, whereas Robin is unable to even hit fighters standing next to him.

Lastly, Robin's durability mechanic can severely weaken Robin once he starts to lose the tomes or the Levin Sword. Losing the Levin Sword gives him pathetic K.O. power despite the Bronze Sword's respectable combo game. Losing Thunder removes one of his only zoning options, as well as losing combo potential. Losing Arcfire costs Robin damage output and even more combo potential. Losing Nosferatu makes Robin's survivability weaker, especially with his average weight. Losing Elwind is the worst case for Robin, as his double jump is merely average, leaving Robin effectively helpless while recovering should he be launched too far offstage without Elwind available.","Overall, Robin is a tactically-based character with varied spacing, damage-accumulating and KO options that must be used wisely and opportunely. At the same time, the lack of mobile and defensive options leave Robin vulnerable to pressure and combos. With this, Robin players must keep track of his weapons' durability, intelligently respond to their opponents, and take precise offensive action for success in battle."
Donkey Kong,10,4.149,"Donkey Kong is ranked 68th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the D+ tier. This is a significant drop from his 22nd out of 54 placement in SSB4, and it is his worst placement in the series to date. Donkey Kong has surprisingly good mobility for a superheavyweight, having both a good dash and air speed, while possessing good KO power fitting for his weight class. He has the highest amount of conventional meteor smashes by default (forward and down aerials, Headbutt and Hand Slap), which gives him many options to net early kills on recovering opponents. His down tilt has a chance to trip; his up tilt is a solid anti air that can kill at high percents, his forward tilt is a good spacing tool, and his dash attack is a long-reaching, general-purpose move that has late-hit combo potential. His aerials are all good as they serve their purpose in Donkey Kong's strong advantage state, with back aerial as a good walling and edgeguarding option, up air as a strong juggling and KO tool, and neutral aerial as a good get-off-me or landing option. Donkey Kong also possesses one of the best throws in the game with his cargo throw, which works exceptionally well against characters with poor to mediocre recoveries, and can also net early KOs while on platforms. His specials are also effective: Giant Punch can now be used in the air without becoming helpless; Headbutt can punish overuse of shields and can armor through opposing attacks; grounded Spinning Kong has armor and functions as a powerful kill move and out of shield option; and Hand Slap can be used to set up for kill confirms and deny grounded approaches.

Despite his strong advantage state, Donkey Kong is held back by notable flaws, the biggest being his disadvantage, which is among the worst in the game. He has one of the largest hurtboxes, and many of his limb-based moves lose intangibility once their hitboxes cease, meaning Donkey Kong is frequently in danger of being clipped by attacks compared to other fighters. He also has little to no option to escape from combos due to his frame 4 air dodge, and not having many moves that are fast enough to combo break, while most of his out-of-shield options are too slow or high-risk. As a result, this makes him one of the easiest characters to juggle. Alongside this, Donkey Kong has a lackluster and risky neutral game, as many of his attacks have high ending lag and a decent chunk of them are unsafe on hit at low percents. His recovery is also one of the most exploitable in the game, as a simple spike is enough for Donkey Kong to quickly lose his stock, since Spinning Kong offers very little vertical distance.

Overall, Donkey Kong is a speedy heavyweight with unique tools and the potential to convert a single throw into early KOs; however, his disadvantage state means a simple mistake can make it hard for him to keep the pressure on. Although historically an unpopular character in competitive play, dedicated players such as ChunkyKong, Rarikkusu and HIKARU have regularly achieved high placements and great wins with the character, improving his representation and perception as time went on.","Donkey Kong is unsurprisingly a large super heavyweight, having the same weight value as King Dedede, and is the third-heaviest character in the game behind Bowser and King K. Rool. Despite this, he's one of the fastest heavy characters in the game, both in terms of general mobility and attack speed. He has the 10th fastest walking speed, the 29th fastest dashing speed, the 16th highest traction, above average falling speed and jumping force, and is tied with Mario, Sonic, Little Mac, and Inkling for the 13th fastest air speed. In contrast, he has below average gravity and moderately slow air acceleration.
","A typical heavyweight is expected to possess moves with high power, and Donkey Kong is no exception to this - it is possibly his greatest attribute. Donkey Kong has no problem with setting up into KOs with moves that have both high power and decent range: his sweetspotted up tilt, smash attacks, aerials, back throw, Giant Punch, and grounded Spinning Kong are all prime examples. His ability to take stocks with his powerful attacks is made easier with his decent approach. His mobility and size work together to give him an effective grounded approach and longer range, respectively. All of these attributes combined allow him to have an easier time fighting in close quarters and landing attacks on his opponents. He also has very strong survivability thanks to his aforementioned high weight and above average falling speed, which is also common for his archetype. In total, Donkey Kong's attributes give him some of the best overall endurance in the game, with only Bowser and King K. Rool surpassing him horizontally.

Donkey Kong works well with his grounded moveset. His neutral attack has decent damage and startup. Forward tilt's long range makes it one of his main spacing tools and works better with its intangibility. Up tilt is a safe move to interrupt his opponents, with the move covering Donkey Kong's entire body, acting as an anti-air, and hitting through low platforms such as the ones on Battlefield. Down tilt gives him a long range crouching option and has a chance to trip opponents. His dash attack works as a combo starter and a situational KO option at low and very high percentages, respectively. All of his smash attacks are notoriously strong and relatively fast, making them his go-to options for hard reads and scoring KOs. His aerial options also have considerable utility. His forward and down aerials are some of his best edgeguarding tools due to both of them being meteor smashes. His neutral aerial is hard to interrupt, helps him break out of combos, and is one of the strongest of its type in the game when hit clean. His up aerial serves as an effective vertical KO option (if the situation he's in allows for it) thanks to its high knockback, and it is also safe, as his head is intangible during it and it has modest end lag. His back aerial is his fastest aerial and is debatably an even better spacing tool than his forward tilt, being fast, long-ranged, and having a sex kick-like hitbox, with a long duration and high knockback when hit clean. His air speed allows his aerial moves to be used at their fullest potential and, with the exception of forward aerial, they’re all decently fast.

A well-known part of his playstyle is his grab game, as he has a long grab that allows for setups into the rest of his moves. Although his down throw has little to no use, every other option does to some extent. His pummel is slower compared to many others in the cast, but deals decent damage. Up throw has combo potential into his aerials and back throw is his primary kill throw, but his forward throw is easily his most useful one and possibly the most unique part of his character. During his forward throw, Donkey Kong can move, jump, and walk off the stage while having the opponent in his hands, acting like he usually would outside of a typical grab (aside from being unable to use his other moves and having only one jump). Forward throw also gives Donkey Kong different types of throws based on what direction is pressed, basically giving him eight throws; these are commonly known as the ""cargo throws."" Cargo forward and down throw both work as niche edgeguarding options, with cargo down throw even being a semi-spike. Cargo back throw does good damage and is a very solid kill throw. It also has utility as a stage spike unless his opponent is able to properly tech it. Finally, cargo up throw has more combo potential than his vanilla up throw, being able to combo into his aerials at low percents. Cargo up throw also possesses fairly good kill power, since Donkey Kong can jump and then heave his opponents for additional height.

Donkey Kong's special moves are also helpful for his gameplan. Giant Punch is his surprise KO and punish move, can be used to pressure the opponent, and has super armor if fully charged. Headbutt can bury opponents, which can allow him to setup into KOs, and spikes in the air. It has super armor during the move's startup and deals very high shield damage while also having deceptively long range, giving him a shield pressure option and the ability to call out poor shield positioning. Grounded Hand Slap has very long range and allows for stage control, but has no usage for aerial opponents, as it leaves Donkey Kong immobile and its hitbox only deals damage to grounded opponents. The aerial Hand Slap is his last move which can meteor smash and is fast, making it effective and easy to land. His final special move, Spinning Kong, acts similarly to Bowser's Whirling Fortress as his primary out of shield option. It is hard to disrupt and is a multi-hit move with high damage. In the air, it works as an incredibly fast horizontal recovery option and deals a lot of damage if all the hits connect. Due to the speed Spinning Kong has in the air, it can work as an effective combo breaker.","However, despite his versatile moveset and high power, Donkey Kong falls into a plethora of problems. His defensive game is very poor, a common issue for characters of his size. While his massive weight gives him very high endurance and his large frame is the reason his range is better than characters like Mario and Squirtle, it becomes a problem when having to dodge attacks which is hard for him because he is a very large target. His tie hurtbox is also extremely large, further exacerbating the issue. Coincidentally, just like those two previously mentioned fighters, he has frequent trouble dealing with characters that have disjoints due to his lack of projectiles, primarily against swordfighters such as Shulk and Ike, hitboxes on moves such as Mewtwo's up and back aerials, or fast multi-hits such as Palutena's neutral air. Donkey Kong's size also makes him vulnerable to combos and juggling, which is worsened by his lack of combo breakers (outside of neutral aerial and up special). The reintroduction of directional air dodges makes his aerial defense even more linear, and the new air dodge's increased ending lag hurts all characters; it debatably hurts a character such as Donkey Kong the most. Moreover, his otherwise great forward throw (cargo throw) also has certain drawbacks - notably, the risk of trying to slam the opponent into the ledge with a backward cargo throw. Due to Donkey Kong's horrid vertical recovery, if the opponent either DIs fast enough, squat jumps on him or simply has better air reach, this attempt for an easy KO may backfire. The trajectory of both forward and back cargo throw also possess a minor challenge. Unlike traditional forward and back throws, Donkey Kong sends the opponent at a high vertical angle instead of horizontal. This makes it more situational if they will KO or not, especially cargo forward throw. Cargo back throw ironically has more vertical range than his cargo up throw and therefore has more usage KOing at the top of the screen than the side. Thus, the player may find more reliability in a normal back throw near the edge.

Despite many of his moves having fast startup, Donkey Kong's moveset is made much slower by its ending lag, and most of his moves are not safe on hit at low percents. This forces him to be more careful with the moves he uses, as he can be heavily punished just for putting out one attack (a situation that can rapidly snowball due to his poor defensive options). Unlike the all-around heavyweight Bowser, perhaps Donkey Kong's most glaring weakness is his lack of out-of-shield options. Neither his neutral attack nor his tilts are enough to distance himself from an aggressive opponent if the player forces him to remain in shield. His forward tilt has good range, but lacks the power or perks of other super heavyweights, like Bowser's Tough Guy or King K. Rool's Belly Armour. A lot of his moves are also limited in some way despite their strengths: his smash attacks are slow and have very linear hitboxes; a chunk of his throws, despite their variety, don't have much utility; Giant Punch forces Donkey Kong to get up-close to the opponent to land the attack and needs to be charged for it to be effective; Headbutt and Hand Slap are both slow, causing them to be difficult to use for their intended purposes; and Spinning Kong, while it has decently long horizontal recovery distance, offers almost no vertical recovery and is prone to edgeguarding against meteor smashes, like Captain Falcon and Falco's down aerials.","All in all, Donkey Kong's mixture of fast mobility, fairly long range, high weight, decent combo potential, and excellent kill power make him adept and flexible in many different situations, but killing and pressuring opponents stand out as his biggest strengths. Despite this, DK's high weight, large hurtbox, and lack of good escape tools make him vulnerable to many combos. In addition, his recovery is extremely poor, and his moveset is frequently punishable due to the end lag on many of his moves. As such, Donkey Kong has to capitalize on his power and range to limit opponents' approaches in order to win matches."
Isabelle ,10,4.12,"Isabelle is ranked 69th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her at the end of the D+ tier. Isabelle possesses good defensive play, and excellent ledge trapping; owing to her slingshot, special moves, and fast close-range moves. Isabelle also has a good juggle, making it difficult for the opponent’s to safely land via her up aerial, up tilt, and aforementioned traits. Isabelle is considered to have better close-range moves than Villager, such as Jab, Forward Tilt, and Up Tilt, the latter of which is an excellent combo starter. Somewhat akin to Sonic's perception in Ultimate, Isabelle is often considered to be frustrating to play against, particularly for her tendency to avoid unsafe interactions in some matchups. This can cause opponent's to make risky approaches, providing opportunities for Isabelle to punish. Notably, Isabelle's unique jab gives her the ability to perform the ""Wobbelle"" technique, which can trap opponents at the ledge up to KO percentages.

However, Isabelle has numerous drawbacks. Some include poor offense, low damage output, sluggish movement, low weight, a slow grab, and a difficulty in closing stocks. In addition, both Lloid Trap and Fishing Rod have significant flaws that hinder their reliability. Isabelle’s Lloid Trap can be easily destroyed by many characters, causing a explosion that uniquely hurts the user. Furthermore, if the trap hasn’t been set off or destroyed within ten seconds, it will disappear entirely. Fishing Rod will sometimes disconnect if a platform obstructs Isabelle’s ability to reel in her line. In addition, what happens when this occurs is rather unpredictable; ranging from breaking off immediately, to bringing her catch in, without performing a throw. While the latter can be desirable, the effect is neither common nor controllable. Losing her catch often results in no punish, and can leave her vulnerable to a counter attack.

Overall, Isabelle's weaknesses hold her back in competitive play and she is considered unviable in the current metagame. However, her standing and results have nevertheless improved since the launch of the game, due to buffs in balance patches and efforts from players such as Jaka, Nery, and Rokki.","Isabelle is a relatively short and floaty lightweight with slow overall mobility. As a semi-clone of her fellow Animal Crossing fighter Villager, both characters have several similarities to each other. However, Isabelle is characterized by a lighter weight, floatier physics and lacks the ability to wall jump. Aside from her slower falling speed, she demonstrates marginally quicker mobility, both on the ground and in the air. In turn, Isabelle sports the 12th slowest dashing speed (although she has a decent initial dashing speed), slightly above-average walking speed, average air speed, below-average air acceleration, the 6th lowest gravity (tied with Peach, Daisy and Steve), is tied with Wii Fit Trainer and Ice Climbers for the 10th slowest falling speed, an average jumping height, and the 5th highest traction (tied with Ness, Villager and Mr. Game & Watch). Moreover, Isabelle also has multiple attacks that are unique to her (such as all of her smash attacks), and even the moves she shares with Villager have different animations and mechanics.","Isabelle's grounded moves have their utility mainly due to their range and low startup, as all of her standard grounded moves have less than 10 frames of startup. Neutral attack is Isabelle's fastest grounded move, and while it is a weak single-hit move, it can be used to combo into her smash attacks at high percentages and is a reliable jab lock. Forward tilt is useful when spaced thanks to its decent knockback and range, while also serving as a situational KO option at higher percentages. Up tilt's disjointed hitbox makes it an effective anti-air attack and juggling option, while its low knockback and relatively fast speed also make it a useful combo move. Down tilt possesses decent range as well, while the sweetspot close to her is strong enough to KO at high percentages.

Dash attack is a projectile that can be used on platforms against opponents on the ground or on lower platforms, and it can also be used near the ledge for edgeguarding or potentially as a 2 frame punish. Her smash attacks also have some utility as well: forward smash is her strongest KO option if sweetspotted; up smash hits twice and is her best vertical KO move while also comboing into up aerial at low percentages; and down smash is a semi-spike that can be used for KOing near the ledge, edgeguarding, and 2 frame punishes.

Isabelle's aerials autocancel in a short hop. Neutral aerial is Isabelle's fastest aerial and typically her best out of shield option, and has sex kick properties that enable it to combo into Isabelle's other moves or break out of combos. Forward and back aerials involve her firing slingshot pellets that are useful for approaching, spacing and edgeguarding; back aerial has slower startup but less ending lag than forward aerial, and is stronger as well. Finally, up and down aerials have her always swing two turnips as opposed to also one or three like Villager, making them more consistent overall. With her ability to maintain offstage presence, due to her floaty nature, Isabelle's mix of fast and long-ranged aerials make edgeguarding one of the focal points of her strengths.

Isabelle's grab game also has some utility. Isabelle uses a net as part of her tether grab, which has a longer range than normal grabs, but more startup and ending lag as a result. Isabelle can notably use her grab to pocket items. Down throw can be used to initiate aerial combos, forward throw can setup edgeguards rather effectively, and back throw is a potent KO throw, being among the strongest back throws in the game. Up throw deals decent damage, but its lack of utility other than setting up a juggling scenario otherwise makes it Isabelle's least useful throw.

Isabelle sports versatile special moves. Her neutral special, Pocket, allows her to steal an opponent's projectile and send it back at them, helping to discourage projectile camping against her. Her down special, Lloid Trap, has her planting Lloid into the ground. Lloid Trap will active whenever an opponent walks over Lloid or can be activated manually, making it useful for surprising opponents, though it also takes notable time to plant and leaves her vulnerable, not being active until frame 51. However, despite this flaw, Lloid establishes another notable strength Isabelle possesses, ledge trapping; when planted in the correct position, Lloid alone can cover rolling and jumping get up's while Isabelle herself can attempt to cover other get-up options, allowing her to have an easier time maintaining advantage.

In addition, Lloid has other forms of utility; it can combo into up aerial if Isabelle is close enough, making it a KO confirm at higher percentages. Lloid also has the niche application known as ""Glyroid""; when manually detonating Lloid during her initial dash, Isabelle will quickly slide a short distance, allowing it to be used as a movement mix-up for approaching. Her side special, Fishing Rod, allows her to grab and throw opponents from distances farther than her grab can, while it also functions as a tether recovery and an edgeguarding tool, as the fact that it can hang offstage allows her to catch opponents with slower recoveries. Her up special, Balloon Trip, provides vast vertical and horizontal distance, though it travels a slightly shorter distance than Villager's version. This, in addition to her Fishing Rod's great horizontal distance, makes Isabelle notoriously difficult to gimp.","However, Isabelle does have her flaws, one of the most notable being her disadvantage state. Due to her floatiness and low weight, she struggles to return to the ground safely, which makes her more vulnerable to juggling and early knockouts. Additionally, Isabelle’s aerials offer limited coverage beneath her. Her options for mixing up movement are limited, with B-reversing Pocket and committal directional air dodges being among the few options available. Her below average survivability, and having to rely on a rather slow and vulnerable recovery when far from the stage (Balloon Trip), only compounds these issues. At higher levels of play, these flaws can be greatly taken advantage of by some characters - possibly forcing her into continual evasion and defensive tactics, just to escape disadvantage state.

Many of her special moves have major flaws. While her Fishing Rod is a versatile command grab with a very good range, it is flawed in many ways. Unlike all other grabs in the game, it is unusually capable of being shielded and suffers from a lot of ending lag, making it very punishable. Lloid Trap is also very flawed; planting Lloid leaves her vulnerable and takes 51 frames to be active, it disappears after only 10 seconds and can easily be destroyed due to it only having 8% of HP, and in some cases the resulting explosion will damage Isabelle herself and some characters can even run through it without getting affected. While Isabelle's recovery is very long-distanced, she has no way to defend herself while using Balloon Trip, due to the move lacking a hitbox, and popping the balloons will render her helpless, meaning that despite her recovery being fairly good on paper, it is among the most easily edgeguarded in practice. Finally, Isabelle notably lacks some of Villager's most important tools for zoning in the neutral game, namely Lloid Rocket and Timber, making her vastly worse at zoning than her counterpart.","Overall, Isabelle is a more risk adverse character than Villager, having much weaker zoning, but greater punish options and more reliable stage control. This is partially due to her special attacks having notable flaws, as well as possessing inferior endurance due to her lighter weight and slower falling speed. Some of her benefits are directly tied to being in an advantageous game state, despite having a worse neutral than Villager, making her strengths less accessible."
Bowser Jr.,10,3.857,"Bowser Jr. is ranked 70th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him at the top of the D- tier. This is a very slight improvement over his 47th out of 54 placement in SSB4. Bowser Jr. has a unique type of playstyle using his signature Clown Kart for his neutral game. His Clown Kart now takes priority for his hurtbox, taking regular damage compared to himself. Bowser Jr. has capable normals for racking up damage. For example, his rapid jab is noteworthy for being a viable KO tool and is rather quick too, coming out on frame 4. His tilts also serve some purpose as good poking tools that linger. His grab game is also strong as his up throw leads into multiple up aerials and a strong advantage state and combo game with juggling and his down throw is good for racking up damage and stage positioning. His forward and back throws are also solid as they are good setups for edgeguards or potent KO moves at higher percentages. His other aerials, like his forward aerial and back aerial, are solid disjoints to help Jr's range and viable KO moves. Bowser Jr's smash attacks are also useful as solid finishers, with forward smash coming out fairly quick and little endlag, up smash is a quick out-of-shield option, coming out on frame 7, and down smash is a fast smash attack that hits on both sides simultaneously. Bowser Jr's special moves also have their fair share of strengths. His Clown Kart Dash is a strong burst option that greatly improves Bowser Jr's approach and can also combo into certain moves like up aerial and the hammer swing from Abandon Ship!. Clown Kart Dash can also be used for mindgames or for playing defensively to slow down the pace of the match. Clown Cannon is useful for forcing approaches and he can fire two at a time which can apply shield pressure. Mechakoopa is his main stage control move that can also be used for mindgames or KO setups due to its property as an item.

However, Bowser Jr. has several weaknesses that balance out his strengths. His overall mobility is mediocre so he has to rely a lot on his Clown Kart for movement. While his Clown Kart takes priority over his hurtbox, Bowser Jr. himself will take more damage compared to the kart. Due to him being a heavyweight, it also makes Jr. easy to combo and juggle. Bowser Jr's recovery is also exploitable if he is hit while recovering between the kart and the ledge, it renders him unable to recover and gimped. Several of Bowser Jr's moves, such as forward air, back air, down smash, and more have high amounts of endlag, making them fairly risky to throw out and easy for him to be punished. His projectiles are also easily predictable to see coming and avoid which can also be used against him.

Overall, Bowser Jr. is a character that has unique strengths in his toolkit but exploitable weaknesses that are easy to take advantage of. Although his overall representation has been below-average, Bowser Jr. had nevertheless seen tournament success thanks to dedicated players such as Young Eevey in the early metagame and Yoda Cage in the post-online metagame.","Bowser Jr. is a unique heavyweight fighter because his Junior Clown Car has a separate hurtbox from him, making his survivability variable. Bowser Jr. sports the 20th slowest walking speed (tied with Peach and Daisy), the 21st slowest dashing speed, the 26th fastest air speed (tied with Ike and R.O.B.), the 30th fastest falling speed (tied with Ike, Corrin, Sonic, Ganondorf, and Duck Hunt), slightly above average gravity and air acceleration, and low traction. All in all, these stats render his mobility somewhat poor except in the air, and as a result, many characters supersede him in terms of approach.","Bowser Jr. and his Junior Clown Car both have separate hurtboxes, much like Duck Hunt. He possesses a unique mechanic where the Clown Car takes less damage from all incoming attacks, whereas he himself takes more damage in comparison. Unlike in SSB4, the Clown Car's hurtbox takes priority over Bowser Jr.'s hurtbox: when combined with his heavy weight, this gives him above average survivability compared to a good majority of the rest of the cast, or possibly even a good majority of other characters that are of his weight class. Bowser Jr. also possesses a purely disjointed moveset and two good projectiles in Clown Cannon and Mechakoopa.

Clown Cannon can have two cannonballs in play at the same time, deals good damage and knockback, and its cannonballs travel quickly. This makes Clown Cannon good for disrupting or throwing off approaches, as well as KOing at high percentages. This is further compounded by its outstanding shield damage, making Clown Cannon a viable punishing tool. Mechakoopa is also disruptive due to its explosion effect upon being hit. The Mechakoopa always follows opponents no matter the circumstances, and explodes upon contact, serving as an excellent KO setup against launched opponents.

Clown Kart Dash travels extremely quickly, vastly making up for Bowser Jr.'s poor approach and allowing him to easily cover long distances, both on the ground and in the air. Clown Kart Dash also deals above-average damage and knockback at maximum speed, enabling it to KO opponents at mid-high percentages. Junior can also double jump out of it, granting him potential aerial follow-ups. Abandon Ship! travels good vertical distance, allowing Junior to return to the stage if he is right below it. The Junior Clown Car itself damages opponents upon exploding, serving as a potential KO option at later percentages. While outside of the clown car, Bowser Jr. is gifted with a hammer, which deals high damage, high knockback, and has quick startup, making it a good KO option in its own right. Clown Kart Dash and Abandon Ship! can be mixed up with an air dodge, combining to give Junior an impressive recovery.

Bowser Jr.'s aerials have great utility, going hand-in-hand with his specials. Neutral aerial has edgeguarding capabilities and is effective out-of-shield because of its lingering hitbox. His forward and back aerials are great for edgeguarding, spacing, and KOing because of their high knockback, high potential damage, and good range. Bowser Jr.'s up aerial is good for juggling because of its decent speed and vertical range and serves as an additional KO option. Lastly, down aerial can shield poke, and works well with Clown Kart Dash when initiating follow-ups.

Bowser Jr.'s smash attacks are go-to KO options, all dealing high knockback and overall damage: forward smash has low ending lag, pokes shields, and can be angled; up smash has very quick startup and ending lag, pressures shields, and denies any aerial approaches; and lastly, down smash has high range and KOs, the earliest out of Junior's smash attacks.","Despite his great aerial mobility and damage-racking potential, Bowser Jr. is not without his flaws. One of his biggest problems is that his recovery is glaringly susceptible to gimps. While Abandon Ship! grants him considerable vertical distance, any weak hit will result in Bowser Jr. not being able to respawn the Junior Clown Car, and it doesn't have a hitbox outside of the Clown Car's explosion, making him very vulnerable. Another major problem that Bowser Jr. faces is a lack of viable out-of-shield options; despite his up smash being a fast out-of-shield option with decent kill power, it lacks range and leaves Junior vulnerable if it misses. Additionally, his grab is one of the slowest non-tether grabs, his aerials are either laggy or have poor range for being disjointed and his Mechakoopas will deactivate if they hit a shield, making him susceptible to punishes, and as his traction is one of the lowest in the game, this gives him a poor out-of-shield game. Bowser Jr. is also a very straightforward character, which can make him quite predictable at times. For instance, Clown Cannon and Mechakoopa are important to Bowser Jr.'s neutral game, making it easy (especially for characters such as Fox) to read and shut down his options. Despite his grab range being rather long, his grabs have noticeable start-up and ending lag, and his throws have low utility due to their inability to KO at reasonable percentages outside of forward throw, with only up throw possessing some combo potential. In addition, despite his high power, Bowser Jr. suffers from poor KO potential due to having very few reliable KOing options (his neutral attack finisher, smash attacks and his forward/back aerials), which is further compounded by said options being burdened with considerable ending lag, while his forward smash has low ending lag and is safe on shield, but its multihits don't connect reliably into the final hit. Many of his attacks, such as his tilts, also have poor range, so he fares surprisingly poorly against swordfighters considering his disjointed moveset. Finally, Bowser Jr. takes more damage if he is hit but not his Koopa Clown Car, so he is very vulnerable to aerial approaches and after using Abandon Ship!, and he also struggles with dealing with pressure from his opponents. Since he always takes priority over his Clown Car when thrown, Bowser Jr. is also particularly vulnerable to being grabbed and can be knocked out earlier than a character of his weight class would by strong kill throws.","Overall, Bowser Jr. fares well with a bait-and-punish playstyle like his father does, but he can also be potent at pressuring the opponent thanks to Clown Cannon, Clown Kart Dash, and Mechakoopa. However, his slew of exploitable weaknesses can make him a bit underwhelming overall, and frequently overshadowed compared to the rest of the cast. Because of this, his results and representation have been below-average overall, like in SSB4."
Ike,10,3.829,"Ike is currently ranked 71st out of 82 on the tier list, placing him in the upper of D- tier. This is a moderate drop from his tier placement in SSB4, where he was ranked 39th out of 54, and is his worst placement in the series. Ike's best assets lie in his overall power and range, having some of the strongest moves in the game. His neutral aerial is an infamously effective combo tool thanks to its low landing lag and base knockback, making it an effective option for spacing and initiating combos, including into KO confirms. Additionally, Ike has a promising combo game, as he is able to use down tilt, neutral aerial, down throw and, to a lesser extent, his up throw to confirm into combos at various percentages. Courtesy of Ike's relatively high power, his combos translate into giving him effective 50/50 KO combos for a heavyweight.

However, Ike also has some polarizing weaknesses, most notably his poor disadvantage state. Due to his tall height, heavy weight, slow mobility, and sluggish frame data, Ike is especially susceptible to combo-oriented and/or speedy fighters. His most effective tools are hampered by poor hitboxes or low speed: some examples include his back aerial, which starts too high to hit most standing characters despite its speed, and his neutral aerial, which has a slow hitbox that starts above Ike and renders it very predictable. He is also vulnerable to perfect shielding due to his overall slow aerial attacks and general reliance on aerials, giving him trouble with landing. Finally, Ike suffers from a predictable recovery: both his recovery moves have fixed travel trajectories (either fully horizontal with Quick Draw or fully vertical with Aether), making him reliant on conserving his double jump and rendering him weak to reasonably strong semi-spikes while recovering.

Ike originally achieved very promising results during the early metagame of Ultimate and was usually considered one of the best swordfighters during that time, courtesy of players such as MkLeo and Ryuga. However, his representation notably declined due to his weaknesses becoming exploitable as time went on, and with his best players either dropping him or becoming inactive. Despite currently having below-average representation, Ike has nevertheless maintained some tournament success in the current metagame, thanks to dedicated mains such as Tora and PsyKoD.","Ike is a tall heavyweight swordsman, being tied with Wario, Ridley, Simon, and Richter as the 13th heaviest fighter in Ultimate. Fittingly for a heavyweight, Ike's endurance is respectable at the cost of generally poor mobility: while he has above-average air speed, traction, falling speed, fast falling speed, and gravity, Ike sports the 14th slowest walking speed, the 15th slowest dashing speed, a below-average initial dash, low jumps, and the 8th lowest air acceleration.","Ike's power is a staple of his character; in addition to his moveset having some of the strongest attacks in the game, rage further supplements his fearsome KO potential. Additionally, Ike possesses great, disjointed reach throughout his moveset. His forward smash deals among the highest damage and knockback out of any smash attack, with the clean hit being able to KO most opponents at a mere 75% at the center of Final Destination. It is also useful for mindgames and shield breaks due to its excellent reach (the early hit can hit opponents above and behind him).

Up smash hits in a wide, semi-circular arc that covers Ike. Like his forward smash, it also deals decent damage and knockback, albeit it is generally weaker. However, it is useful for punishing rolls and landings. Down smash is Ike's fastest smash attack, initially hitting on frame 13, while boasting high damage and knockback overall. The move hits from the front and the back of him (the back hit starts on frame 32), with the clean back hit sporting considerably more power than the front. Other notable attacks that possess great damage and knockback include his forward tilt, up tilt, dash attack, back aerial, up aerial, and down aerial.

Ike also has a unique special moveset. His neutral special, Eruption, is chargeable, grants super armor when released half charge or higher, deals very high damage and knockback, and has an excellent vertical reach and the most horizontal range out of his entire kit, all of which make it a fearsome edgeguarding tool. His side special, Quick Draw, is also chargeable and propels him forward, making it a good mix-up in his neutral game as it helps his recovery, mobility, and approach. His up special, Aether, covers decent vertical distance for a recovery move, but minimal horizontal distance. However, the descending hitbox is an incredibly powerful meteor smash that has the potential to KO opponents at 0% when they are offstage, making it quite dangerous to intercept Ike in some circumstances. This move also has solid knockback, which players can use on Out of Shield options and can KO around 100% as of update 8.0.0. His down special, Counter, is among the strongest of their kind in the game, having a 1.2× damage multiplier and dealing excellent knockback. It is also relatively useful for protecting against edge-guarding and disrupting some recoveries.

Ike's combo potential is also respectable, with his neutral aerial being his best combo starter. Not only does it cover a large area around him to protect him from many attacks, but it also deals fairly low knockback and has little landing lag, which allows it to combo into itself or other moves at various percentages. Neutral aerial can also combo into his back aerial or up aerial for semi-reliable KO confirms at moderately high percentages. At low percentages, it can combo into grabs. Additionally, Ike can start combos with his down throw at low percentages, leading to moves such as up tilt, up aerial, or Aether. Finally, his down tilt has low knockback scaling and launches at a mostly vertical angle, making it a consistent, reliable combo starter at most percentages, and has reliable KO confirms into his aerials at high percentages.","Despite his strengths, Ike is not without his fair share of flaws. As mentioned earlier, he possesses slow movement speed (especially on the ground), which causes him to struggle against quick, agile characters. He also has some of the worst frame data in the game, with severe ending lag in most of his attacks and only his neutral attack (frame 4, 3, and 5 for each respective hit), down tilt, and back aerial (both frame 7) coming out faster than frame 10. Back aerial is also his only aerial attack that can autocancel in a short hop. His aforementioned counter is one of his most punishable options due to being arguably the slowest in the game, with a sluggish startup of 9 frames and considerable ending lag (on both the whiff and counterattack). Consequently, characters with superior attack speed can easily overwhelm and punish him, especially if his attacks are whiffed.

Most of Ike's out-of-shield options are slow and committal, granting him a mediocre out-of-shield game. Additionally, Ike's disadvantage state is terrible due to lacking effective options to land or protect him from pressure and juggling. Furthermore, several of his landing options (like neutral aerial) are predictable and/or having short-lasting hitboxes. While his attributes (particularly his heavy weight) grant him long endurance, they also make him easy to combo and juggle; this is further compounded by his unimpressive landing options.

Ike also possesses two linear and predictable recovery moves, Quick Draw and Aether, ultimately making him vulnerable to gimps and low semi-spikes offstage. Quick Draw travels a strictly horizontal distance, and Aether leaves him vulnerable to many attacks when ascending, especially counters and projectiles. These weaknesses grant him a poor approach against many characters, which is exacerbated by his lack of projectiles not allowing him to camp or force approaches from opponents.","Overall, Ike must utilize his excellent punish game and spacing tools to overwhelm opponents, where he can rack up large amounts of damage with little warning, though players must be cautious of his susceptibility to combos and his lacking recovery."
Villager,10,3.776,"Villager is ranked 72nd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing him in the D- tier. This is a huge decline from his ranking in SSB4, where he was ranked 25th out of 54, and worse than Isabelle, his own semi-clone.","Villager is a small middleweight (weighing the same as Lucario, Wolf, Mythra, Ice Climbers, and Steve) who is an overall floaty character of below-average mobility. Although he has an average jumping height, Villager sports a slow falling speed (the 12th slowest, tied with Luigi), and below-average air speed, air acceleration and gravity. Comparatively, Villager has a below-average walking speed and the 7th-slowest dashing speed (although his initial dash is decent). However, his traction is tied with Isabelle, Ness and Mr. Game & Watch for the 5th-highest in the game. Due to these attributes, once the opponent closes the gap, it is difficult for Villager to create space again, although his powerful camping game compensates for that to a degree.","Villager is among the most unorthodox characters on the roster with several unique moves, including multiple standard attacks that are actually projectiles, similar to Mega Man. Villager possesses a strong camping game. His forward and back aerials are long-ranged slingshot attacks which, in combination with Lloid Rocket, are great for harassing opponents from a distance. Opposing projectiles can either be Pocketed or blocked by a tree; Pocket can also be useful for ""stealing"" character-generated items, such as R.O.B.'s Gyro, preventing them from being useable as long as Villager retains them and thus further weakening the opponent's ability to compete with him at range. Despite his poor mobility, Villager possesses a reliable sex kick in his neutral aerial that has very quick startup at frame 3, giving him a relatively easy time restraining the opponents if attempting to approach to point-blank proximity.

Should camping not be desirable, Villager's projectiles can also serve as good approaching tools. In particular, launching Lloid Rocket and then running behind it is a strategy that limits the opponent's options and provides a chance to punish their reaction. Using his forward and back aerials in a short hop is also a good approaching option, as they are reasonably safe disjointed attacks with little lag.

Despite being a middleweight, Villager possesses a surprisingly flexible recovery thanks to Balloon Trip. This move allows him to fly a great distance at a respectable speed, and is surprisingly difficult to gimp; although the balloons can be popped to render Villager helpless, hitting Villager himself will allow him to simply perform the move again. Lloid Rocket further bolsters Villager's recovery, as launching it stalls his descent while threatening edgeguarders. Alternatively, Villager can ride Lloid back to the stage, although this is punishable and can be reflected.

Villager is also a very potent edgeguarder, with a wealth of options to threaten recovering opponents. His forward smash, one of the strongest in Ultimate, allows him to drop a bowling ball from the ledge; this is a powerful attack that can be difficult for an opponent to avoid provided that they are recovering low. If the opponent's recovery is slow enough or a tree is set up beforehand, Timber can also be performed from the ledge for an even more devastating attack, or to reduce an opponent's options should they grab the ledge. Alternatively, Villager can jump offstage and pursue with an aerial attack; his down aerial is a powerful meteor smash should it produce three turnips, while a clean hit from his slingshot has enough knockback to be deadly near the blast line, and is generally the best choice against an opponent recovering high. Several of his aerials are sex kicks as well, which, when combined with his extremely long-ranged recovery, allows him to gimp opponents fairly easily.","However, Villager suffers from notable flaws. Villager's ability to set up edgeguards in the first place is impaired by his slow grab. Although his net has relatively long range, it has exceptionally high ending lag that makes it very punishable. As such, attempting to throw an opponent offstage is a risky prospect, and Villager's ability to shield grab is quite limited, although he does have other good out of shield options, such as his neutral aerial and up smash. In addition, Villager's poor mobility also allows speed demons, such as Fox and Sonic, to not only easily outrun him, but also immediately catch up to him and shut down Villager's camping game. Furthermore, Villager also especially struggles against characters with a reflector, as since most of his projectiles are characterized with high power (like his forward smash and Timber), characters with reflectors can reflect the projectile and turn the tides by dealing a potentially deadly blow from Villager's reflected projectile that can often lead into an early KO, even at lower precents. A notable example is Mr. Game & Watch: if Villager successfully cuts off Timber, Mr. Game & Watch can use Oil Panic and send the tree flying back to Villager with extreme knockback. By extension, Oil Panic can also reflect Villager's powerful forward smash, which is also a projectile, and can prove deadly when Villager is near the ledge, especially at higher precents of with rage.

Outside of edgeguarding, Villager has multiple powerful KO moves, but none of them are easy to land from a neutral situation. His forward smash, while powerful, is a laggy and short-ranged attack when performed onstage. Up smash is a potent KO option, but is very punishable as well and is susceptible to opponents falling out of the move entirely due to its multi-hitting nature. Lloid Rocket has relatively high KO power when ridden, but is sluggish and easy to punish. Timber's axe requires a tree to be present and has considerable ending lag, while using the tree itself is slow and requires Villager to stand in one place. Villager's up aerial is a strong juggling move and can score KOs off the upper blast line, but is somewhat luck-based and can be reasonably difficult to land. Pocketing and throwing back a sufficiently strong projectile makes for a deadly attack, generally enough to KO at medium percentages and instantly shatter full shields, but this is matchup-dependent and will not be easily allowed by a professional opponent. Overall, if the opponent maintains control of center stage, Villager can have trouble finding KO opportunities, especially lower than medium precents.","Overall, Villager is a somewhat polarizing glass cannon camper who excels when getting his gameplan going, but struggles when the opponent holds the advantage over him. Villager excels at restraining opponents with projectiles to allow enough time to set up traps. Villager especially performs well offstage, where he can easily edgeguard and gimp most of the cast while being able to easily recover from nearly any distance. Due to his array of projectiles and Pocket, Villager also has great counterplay to zoners. However, Villager does not fare better in terms of close-range encounters and can be easily overwhelmed by several rushdowners courtesy of his lackluster approach."
Zelda,10,3.745,"Zelda is ranked 73rd out of 82 on the current tier list, placing her in the D- tier. This is a slight improvement from her 52nd/53rd out of 54 placement in SSB4 where she was tied with Ganondorf, and is her best placement in the series. She has a strong zoning tool in Phantom Slash, which is a very versatile move that can also start or finish combos, force approaches and apply pressure by controlling space, namely in ledge trapping. Zelda uses magic in her attacks with transcendent priority, giving her disjointed range in general. She has an abundance of KO options, with power comparable to or exceeding that of heavyweights, despite being a lightweight. Many of her strongest attacks tend to create favorable trades if not outright beating out the opponent's move due to their priority. They come out surprisingly fast for how powerful they are, many of which are also effective out-of-shield options, most famously her Lightning Kick, which has devastating launching power when sweetspotted, and Farore's Wind, which is also one of the best recoveries in the game due to being a unique teleport that travels far with hitboxes both on disappearance and reappearance. She also has an outstanding array of throws, being able to combo with down throw until high percents and having two strong kill throws in her up and back throws.

Despite these strengths, Zelda has notable weaknesses. Her mobility is among the worst in the game, with a low run speed, falling speed and gravity leaving her with committal jumps and a poor approach and neutral game. Being tall makes her easier to hit, and being floaty makes her especially vulnerable to juggling with poor landing options; this gives her one of the worst disadvantage states in the game and only exacerbates her already low weight. While Zelda has several powerful finishers, most of them are inconsistent, having very precise sweetspots that are especially difficult to land with her poor approach and mobility, weak sourspots that can even be punishable on hit and/or high ending lag. She lacks moves that are safe on shield, most notably her aerials; the few moves that are require specific spacing or timing, which are difficult given her poor mobility. The range on several of her attacks is poor, limiting their utility. Almost all her normals are transcendent, which is a downside against projectiles and larger disjoints due to being unable to clank with them and often losing to them. She also has a limited number of moves and rather small windows to confirm into other moves, forcing her to often rack up damage and secure KOs through Phantom setups or stray hits. She has no fast, low-committal projectiles, making her susceptible to being outcamped; in general, all her special moves have high lag and can be punished hard when not used carefully.

Overall, Zelda plays a decent zoning game and a strong trapping game, with tools for ledge trapping and controlling space, but her precise hitboxes, inconsistency and poor mobility gives her a weak neutral and disadvantage state, making her a glass cannon with a focus on precision. Zelda is rarely represented in tournaments, but there have been dedicated players, such as Yn from Japan, Naskino in France, and Ven in the United States, with respectable results.","Zelda is a tall, floaty lightweight character with overall slow mobility. While she has an above-average air speed, initial dash and traction, her jumps and air acceleration are below average, and she has the 22nd slowest walking speed, the 16th slowest falling speed, the 10th lowest gravity, and is tied with Byleth for the 9th slowest running speed in the game. Zelda's attacks are mostly based on magic, making most of them disjointed albeit short-ranged attacks. They also boast generally quick startup; all her normal attacks activate before frame 10, except for forward tilt, up aerial, down aerial, and forward smash. Despite her low weight, most of her attacks have impressive KO potential and damage output, giving her power comparable to that of heavyweights. Due to these factors, Zelda can be generalized as a zoner glass cannon.","Zelda's ground game is notably safer than her aerial game due to generally having lower lag and being more consistent. She has decent close-quarters combat with many fast moves that can start combos. Her neutral attack is her fastest move at frame 4. It can transition into a rapid jab and its finisher for simple damage and emergency KOs; on its own, though short in range, it can be useful in some situations, such as shield mixups, platform tech-chasing, and confirms at high percentages. Forward tilt, though narrow and precise with slow startup, has a very strong tipper hitbox (being the highest-damage forward tilt in the game, and the second strongest behind Incineroar's) and is used to space (especially on shield) and secure early KOs with its high base knockback. Up tilt is one of her most versatile moves, with large, lingering hitboxes that hit all around her being used to anti-air, catch spot dodges and getups, tech-chase, and start and extend combos across most percentages. It is an important move for KO confirms; landing the back hit can confirm most notably into lightning kick and up air at mid and high percentages, respectively. Down tilt, another one of her most important moves, though quite small, has fast startup, low lag yet a surprisingly long-lasting hitbox (7 frames) that allows it to be used as a quick low-committal poke, a 2-framing option (especially with a set-up Phantom) and for catching ledge getups. The crouching animation allows her to pancake and evade moves in neutral and out of shield. It can be relatively safe on shield if spaced and/or hit with the later frames, though in general the quick animation can make it difficult to punish or to DI in time. It most reliably leads into dash attack at mid percents, but can lead to Lightning Kick at higher percents for a KO confirm, especially with poor DI. Down tilt is often used to cover options in tandem with dash attack, her most important burst option with excellent speed, a good disjoint, a long-lasting hitbox and only moderate ending lag. Proper application of dash attack to catch landings and punish whiffed moves is essential, while avoiding overuse and misuse due to it being unsafe on shield.

Though known for her broad power, Zelda's smash attacks are one of the few areas where she falls relatively average to below-average in strength. Her forward smash is still a strong finisher, however, with one of the largest disjoints of any of her normals. Due to its multiple hits, it is a decent option for catching ledge getups, especially when charged, though unlike Pichu's, it has a 1-frame gap between each of its hits, making it inconsistent at this. Also, due to its rather low ending lag it can be hard to punish on shield, especially if spaced. Up smash is similarly a powerful multi-hit with good disjoint, though only vertically and not as large. While its horizontal range is poor, it has a relatively fast startup (frame 9) that can punish poorly spaced moves on shield. It has a very long duration of 25 frames from the first to last hit with only 2 inactive frames in between, making it effective for catching getups as well as landings, spot dodges and preemptively intercepting reckless approaches. It is one of her laggiest moves, however, which in combination with its unspectacular range makes it a highly committal option that should only be used sparingly. Down smash's foot sweetspots launch opponents at a semi spike angle with decent knockback. At frame 5, it is one of her fastest moves and is a quick punish option with only moderate ending lag. As it hits on both sides, it can be used for catching rolls. It can set up edge guards on characters with poor recoveries due to its nasty launch angle. However, due to being a simple leg sweep and one of her few non-magic attacks, it has a rather short range with average power.

Zelda has unique high-risk, high-reward aerials which boast immense kill power but have high lag, very weak sourspots and/or small sweetspots, limiting their usage in neutral and forcing her to play carefully in the air. The exception to this is her neutral aerial; it does not have a notable strong hit or sweetspot, instead being her least committal, most versatile aerial which ameliorates her subpar neutral and air-to-air game. It can auto-cancel in a short hop and is a multi-hit with fast start-up and many active frames hitting on both sides. It is used as an anti-air and burst option, combo starter or extender, out-of-shield option, shield pressuring tool, and occasionally edge guarding. At lower percents, it can combo mainly into a dash attack when fast-falled, or into an up tilt or dash attack when auto-canceled. At higher percents, it gives Zelda enough space to set up a Phantom or a ledge-trap situation; additionally, for KOs it can edge guard or launch into a set up Phantom. A single hit when fast-falled can pop grounded opponents up and lead into a variety of confirms at higher percents, but this is difficult to land due to her mobility. Despite being her most important aerial in neutral, it suffers from consistency issues. Due to lacking an autolink angle, opponents can fall out of the looping hits, notably if she is moving in any direction too fast. The looping hits have very low hitstun, failing to give the move any drag-down potential and leaving her very punishable if the opponent falls out. It is also hard to control which side the opponent ends up on due to to the looping hits' constantly inward-sending launch angles, making follow-ups difficult. Up aerial is a large, vertically disjointed explosion with a good duration and excellent power. Due to its massive disjoint, it can shark through certain stages. Relative to its power, it has low landing lag, having some combo potential at lower percents when fast falled, and being safe on shield if used on opponents on platforms while falling. While not too risky due to being massive, disjointed and strong all throughout, it has significant startup and ending lag and only covers the range above her, limiting its usage.

Her forward and back aerials, known as Lightning Kicks, are her most polarized moves. Both these aerials have fast startup at frame 6 and possess a devastating sweetspot at her toe, dealing as much as 24% and higher knockback than the vast majority of smash attacks in the game. This makes them work well as punishes on whiffed attacks and as deadly out of shield options for misspaced attacks. However, the sweetspot is tiny and only active for the first frame, making it quite difficult to land. Additionally, they have notable landing lag, rarely going unpunished on shield (though the pancaking during her landing animation can mitigate this), but most significantly cannot auto-cancel in a short hop and have very high ending lag in the air. Furthermore, the sourspots, while rather large, deal pitiful damage with minimal knockback, being punishable even on hit at most percents. This makes them very risky, especially when used as rising aerials, as missing the sweetspot in any way often results in a punish. This leaves her kicks with poor utility in neutral, especially for aerial moves which tend to be safer spacing options. Down air is a meteor smash with a powerful sweetspot on her foot, similar to her Lightning Kicks. While not nearly as fast and strong as her Lightning Kicks, this sweetspot is much larger, making it much easier to connect. Also, unlike the Lightning Kicks, the sourspots linger for longer and always spike opponents downward, making them useful for gimping opponents or leading into a follow-up, especially with the later frames and/or at high percents. Though precise with slow startup, it is one of Zelda's most useful aerials, having the lowest ending lag, being able to auto-cancel in a short hop and tying for the lowest landing lag. Besides being a powerful meteor smash, the clean hit has great utility in platform chases and is a great punish tool, as hitting it on grounded opponents will allow Zelda to combo into Lightning Kick and up air, even at high percents. Overall, her aerials on their own can be awkward for spacing, air-to-air combat, and starting combos, instead functioning more strongly in conjunction with and as follow-ups to other moves.

One of the moves that most boosts the potency of her aerials is her down special, Phantom Slash, which is also her most important tool. It's a unique projectile that she builds piece-by-piece until it is fully formed, which takes a little under a second; starting on frame 15, she can have it attack at any stage of its creation by pressing either the special or attack button. The Phantom has a hurtbox and HP; these as well as its attack properties vary depending on its charge. The earliest stages have low damage, knockback, range and HP, being limited to zoning or tanking weaker projectiles. However, it becomes increasingly more potent as it becomes more complete, with the later stages having an invincible shield (similar to Hero's and the Links'), and the final stage having high HP, damage output, impressive knockback and stellar range. After just over a second, Zelda will be able to move and attack freely. The Phantom will attack on its own after about another second if it is not manually released, granting Zelda much flexibility during this window. She can attack in tandem with it in ledge traps and to mitigate the vulnerability of laggy moves. It is quite good at comboing into other moves or being a combo finisher itself, especially since it and many of Zelda's other moves have high hitlag. Other usages include playing mind games with manual releases on opponents stuck in shield, retreating behind it for protection (namely against projectiles), punishing opponents stuck in hitlag if they hit the Phantom, punishing shielding opponents with grabs or shield break combos, covering opponents' high recoveries while she covers below, or even covering her own recovery (similar to Din's Fire) and especially her ledge getups. Phantom Slash forms the basis of Zelda's kit and is designed to compensate for Zelda's lackluster neutral, allowing her to gain stage control, cover options, pressure, zone and trap because of how much space it covers, how much damage it deals, and how many different mixups Zelda can do with it. With precise input, Zelda can also short hop behind the Phantom while charging it to create a ""displaced Phantom,"" allowing it to block incoming projectiles while charging and making it harder for the opponent to interrupt Zelda. Another technique allows Zelda to simultaneously release the Phantom and perform an attack of her own on frame 67 with very precise input, allowing for an overwhelming onslaught of hitboxes. While Phantom is reflectable, Zelda can mix up her timing by delaying the attack, leaving the opponent having to predict when to activate their reflector. Phantom Slash's main weakness is that it cannot be charge-canceled, requiring Zelda to commit to either an early release or to wait until she is actionable again. In addition, if she enters hitstun at any point before releasing the Phantom, it falls apart, limiting the use of one of her best tools in neutral. Phantom Slash has a few blind spots, and the windboxes on the highest charges are also sometimes not strong enough to connect into the slash, although sometimes they can gimp on their own.

Outside Phantom Slash, the rest of her special moves take inspiration from the spells of the three Golden Goddesses that Link can use in Ocarina of Time. Her neutral special move, Nayru's Love, is a reflector that doubles as a melee attack; Zelda also is intangible from frames 4-13 of the move. These traits make it useful against projectile users as well as beating out moves and disrupting strings. It also has a good duration and horizontal range on both sides of her, giving it use in 2-framing and edge guarding. However, due to having no hitlag, it can easily be teched to avoid stage spikes by using the sound clip as a cue to time the shield input. Its multi-hits can be inconsistent, especially if Zelda is moving or if the opponent is too high or low relative to the hitboxes. It is also very unsafe, especially on shield, making it highly punishable. Din's Fire, her side special move, sends out a slow ball of fire that explodes on the release of the button or when reaching max charge, becoming more powerful and moving faster the longer it is charged. It possesses a powerful sweetspot in the inner part of the explosion, with a weak but otherwise large sourspot. The explosion itself can be reflected or absorbed, but the ball of fire cannot be interacted with. In addition, for the first time in the series, Zelda can use it off stage, as it no longer leaves her helpless in midair. While powerful, its trajectory is very limited and the explosion delay is noticeable, making it easy to avoid in most cases, and quite punishable if used in neutral. Instead, it is mostly used for off-stage play; while it can usually only gimp opponents with poor recoveries, it can otherwise at least force an air dodge/low recovery, leading into a ledge trap opportunity with Phantom. Her up special move, Farore's Wind, is a fantastic recovery tool, allowing her to make it back to stage in almost any off-stage situation. As a teleport recovery, it can be tricky to edgeguard Zelda due to its intangibility and impressive omnidirectional distance, but it has vulnerability during its startup, and certain characters can threaten her at ledge if they have a 2-framing option. However, it has anti-2-frame and mindgame potential if one opts to use the aforementioned powerful second hitbox instead of snapping to ledge, or teleport from above ledge to avoid the two-frame vulnerability completely. Much like Palutena's Warp, albeit significantly more difficult, she can completely avoid the move's ending lag by edge cancelling, which grants her access to otherwise-impossible approach, stage control, shield-breaking and landing options. Due to its large hitboxes, quick startup and high knockback, it functions as a deadly out of shield option, though DIing out of the second hit is possible. The first hit can also be used on its own out of shield to inflict small damage and simply reset neutral, avoiding the risk of missing the second hit. It can work as a burst option to punish laggy options or anti-zone from a distance, but due to its high ending lag, this option is usually very risky. While having unique uses in their own rights, her specials can be strategically be used with each other for creative KOs.

Zelda has good range for her grab, with her pivot grab being one of the most disjointed in the game. While having notably slow startup, her throws have great reward. Forward throw is good to set up edge guarding and ledge traps, while back and up throw are excellent kill throws and among the strongest of their kind. Down throw is most useful as a combo starter, and can reliably combo into neutral aerial, forward aerial or back aerial (depending on DI) from low to mid percents. All her throws can lead into a set up Phantom with proper timing for high-damage combos or KO confirms, though forward and down throw are the most practical.","Despite her strengths, Zelda has big weaknesses. Chief among them is her poor mobility, which hamper her ability to approach and punish safely on the ground and in the air. This mobility issue is exacerbated through numerous frame data issues, as many of her attacks, while quick to start up, have punishing amounts of end lag and precise hitboxes, making her approach telegraphed. In particular, her floatiness makes her air-to-ground transition poor and exacerbates the downsides of her already awkward aerials. Since she is tall and floaty, with no safe landing mixups or options to help her from ledge, she is extremely vulnerable to getting juggled and ledgetrapped, contributing to one of the worst disadvantages in the game, compounding the endurance issues from her light weight. Other issues include poor range on her normals, limiting their utility, and extremely weak sourspots that can be punished even on hit. Her combo game is average to subpar; while up tilt is excellent, many of her moves have too much lag, mediocre launch angles and/or unfavorable knockback values for reliable follow-ups or wide combo windows. Her aerials especially have unusually limited follow-ups compared to other fighters due to their lag. Due to this, she partially relies on Phantom to start or finish combos for damage-racking. Some of her multi-hit moves also have consistency issues, namely neutral aerial and Nayru's Love.

Finally, her special moves have exploitable weaknesses; Nayru's Love and Farore's Wind have large amounts of ending lag, making them easy to punish when overused. Farore's Wind also requires following DI to KO off the top. Din's Fire is for the most part too slow and telegraphed to be effective for camping, edge guards or in neutral. Most importantly, Phantom Slash is a large commitment, as Zelda is stuck either in startup if she wants to set up the Phantom as a trap, or she is stuck in ending lag if she releases it manually. This means that, with correct timing and spacing around the Phantom's possible attack ranges, opponents can punish Zelda by preemptively reading when she decides to charge Phantom, limiting her best ability to control space, zone and trap. If there is space, the opponent can also retreat to disengage with the Phantom, with Zelda not being able to do much about it except gaining some stage control. Especially against mobile characters, this forces her to play a neutral with her risky, short ranged neutral tools and subpar mobility.

Among favorable matchups, Zelda excels against slower characters with poor ground and aerial approaches where Phantom Slash can effectively wall them out (Ice Climbers), large characters that become easy targets for her normally precise sweetspots (King K. Rool), especially those without safe options on shield, allowing easy punishes with her deadly out of shield options (King Dedede), and characters with poor recoveries for whom Din's Fire becomes a legitimate threat in conjunction with Phantom (Ganondorf). Zelda's weaknesses mean she struggles with quick opponents who can bait out her options and keep her in disadvantage (Fox, Greninja, Zero Suit Samus), can be camped by characters with projectiles that are fast and/or dwarf the Phantom's range (R.O.B., Young Link, Min Min), can be outranged and overwhelmed by characters with large disjoints who can challenge Knight setups and out-neutral her (Cloud, Aegis), and struggle against characters with better boxing options than her (Shotos).","Overall, Zelda's strengths include fast and powerful out of shield options, good stage control and ledgetrapping with Phantom setups, and impressive kill power spread broadly across her moveset. Her weaknesses in mobility, range, frame data, consistency and sweetspot issues mean that she must be precise with how she spaces her attacks, and she must make the most out of Phantom ledge traps with proper reads and option coverage. She must be creative in her approaches to overcome her mobility issues when she does not have a lead, and must mix up what she does to get out of disadvantage due to her floaty nature and lack of safe landing options."
Simon,10,3.656,"Simon, alongside his Echo Fighter Richter, are ranked 74th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing the Belmonts in the D- tier. The Belmonts are well known for their strong zoning and keeping opponents away from them thanks to their arsenal of projectiles and their range thanks to their signature whip. They are good at harassing their opponents in neutral and keeping them in a disadvantage for long periods of time. Their strengths culminate in them at the ledge, with several tools for ledgetrapping, such as Holy Water and forward tilt. Uppercut is an effective out-of-shield option against aggressive players or those who can get in their defense. The Belmonts also have the unique property to angle some of their aerials, namely forward air and back air to hit opponents low to the ground or anti-air them. Overall, the Belmonts are effective at controlling the pace of the match.

However, the Belmonts are equipped with a multitude of crippling weaknesses. Their disadvantage state is among one of the worst in the game due to not having a single viable combo escape, with the exception of down air, which can be predictable. They also suffer from one of the worst recoveries in the game with Uppercut, providing very little horizontal distance and drift and their tether recoveries not having much reach, allowing any character in the game to edgeguard them consistently if sent offstage.

The Belmonts are formidable zoners with tools to constantly keep their distance, but opponents who get past their flurry of projectiles can often take advantage of their poor defensive game, and make it difficult for them to reset to neutral. Thus, they are difficult characters to be consistent with at a high level. While their representation have dropped after the first few years of the game, they have seen some respectable tournament results and representation from players, such as T3 Dom and YoseFu.","Simon is a heavyweight fighter with a handful of effective projectiles and incredibly long disjointed attacks. In turn, he is burdened with poor mobility, especially in the air, and shares his attributes with his descendant and Echo Fighter, Richter; despite having the 8th-fastest falling and fast falling speed, he has below-average gravity, the 4th slowest walk speed, the 13th-slowest dash and air speed, and is tied with Snake for the lowest air acceleration in the game. He also has the 5th lowest traction, tied with Bowser Jr. and King Dedede.","One of Simon's most notable traits are his notorious projectiles within his special moves. Firstly, Axe is a very strong projectile that can be thrown in three angles, which makes it effective at both edgeguarding and a threatening anti-air option, compounded by its ability to go through solid terrain. The axe can additionally lead into forward aerial, or, at higher percents, Uppercut for a KO. His side special, the Cross, functions like a boomerang, though unlike other boomerang projectiles, it does not follow Simon, instead going straight and then briefly going backwards on its own if not grabbed by Simon; in addition to this, it sends opponents vertically in the air with low knockback, which is favorable for setups into aerial attacks, the Axe, or an up smash. His up special, Uppercut, is a very fast out of shield option with decent kill power that has multiple setups into it, such as the Cross, or more notably, down aerial. Finally, his down special, Holy Water is a great projectile for ledge-trapping, combo setups or kill setups such as a forward smash, forward tilt, or Uppercut; its flame effect also enables it to detonate Young Link and Toon Link's bombs as well as Link's Remote Bombs.

Simon's other notable trait is his impressive range. His Vampire Killer whip offers the overall second longest disjointed range out of any fighter in the roster, and it makes his overall kit well-rounded and versatile. In the air, despite his aerial mobility being sluggish, his aerials are effective in their own rights; his up, forward and back aerials all have impressive range and can be used as tether recoveries, along with the latter two having the unique ability to be angled. His down aerial, while lacking the disjoint of his other aerials, is a notoriously effective combo tool, as it functions much like Greninja's down aerial; it meteor smashes at the beginning, but what makes it versatile is its late hit. On the late hit, both Simon and the opponent will bounce back up at diagonal angles, which opens up many KO confirms, notably into his Uppercut. At low percentages, it can combo into itself multiple times, which can potentially make it a zero-to-death tool if the opponent reacts poorly.

Simon's range is also effective on the ground, as his sluggish frame data is compensated by his attacks having immense range and power at the spiked ball at the end of the whip, to the point where they can be considered safe on shield if spaced, despite their lag. All of his smash attacks are notable examples of this; his forward smash is very powerful when tippered, and when combined with its ability to be angled, this makes it a deadly edgeguarding and ledge-trapping tool. His up smash is very strong when tippered, making it a reliable anti-air tool and a combo finisher and KO confirm out of his Cross. His down smash hits on both sides like most others, and keeps his trademark range while possessing decent power when sweetspotted. His forward tilt possesses decent range and uncharacteristically low ending lag, his dash attack is relatively quick and effective for crossing up shielding opponents, and his down tilt, while not disjointed, is a unique two-hit move that causes him to pseudo-crawl, allowing him to cross up foes or effectively retreat from the corner. Due to Simon's excellent range and his three projectiles, he is very good at keeping the opponent at bay.

Simon also has a good grab game. His grab has below-average range and possesses noticeable lag, but his dash grab gives him a lot of momentum due to his low traction. His throws also have great utility: his forward and back throws have good KO potential despite their rather quick speed, and can be used to set up edgeguards otherwise. His up throw is considered to be his most useful throw, as its decent damage is compounded with its great setup ability, being able to start juggles. His down throw is rather situational and is his least used throw, but nevertheless has combo potential thanks to Simon's range.","Despite all these strengths, Simon has some glaring weaknesses. Perhaps his most infamous shortcoming is his extremely poor recovery, being among the worst in the game, despite having three aerials function as tether recoveries; his very low air movement, combined with Uppercut offering very poor vertical and horizontal momentum, give him very poor offstage presence. As such, he is very easy to gimp, and overall has a slim chance to return to the ledge, making him easy to KO despite his good endurance due to his almost non-existent offstage game. This is further compounded with Simon's susceptibility to combos due to his heavyweight status, poor aerial attributes, and lack of effective combo breakers within his moveset, preventing him from easily getting out of combos or escaping pressure. Due to his very low traction and slow attacks, he also has a poor out of shield game outside of Uppercut.

Despite his zoning and spacing potential, it is overall burdened by his poor frame data, lackluster overall mobility, and narrow attacks. His slow movement makes him vulnerable to pressure and zoning. To make things worse, he only has one aerial move that comes out before frame 10, and that is his frame 8 neutral aerial, while forward back and up aerials come out on frame 14 and down aerial on frame 13. While he has his projectiles, they each have noticeable startup and are susceptible to being reflected back, which can be a huge turnabout, especially since the projectiles play a huge role in Simon's neutral game. An opponent can also catch Holy Water mid-flight and use it against Simon, as he can only have one out at a time, allowing his opponents to perform combo setups or kill setups on him.

Simon's poor frame data also gives him a mediocre close-range game, as many of his attacks are unsafe if not spaced properly, which often leaves him heavily susceptible to punishment. While Simon's whip attacks have excellent range, they are also very narrow, and some attacks, such as up tilt, up smash, and up aerial only hit directly above Simon, giving him poor hitbox placements and creating big blindspots that can cause them to miss opponents even if they are directly touching him, which hampers his juggle ability and overall punish game, and gives him a hard time hitting smaller characters. Finally, his moves tend to be rather weak when sourspotted, making spacing crucial if the player plans to score an early KO. With his grab range being below-average and his kill power being noticeable with his tipper mechanic, he must keep his space and fish for tippered tilts and aerials for maximum effect, in a similar vein to Marth.","Overall, Simon is a fighter who excels when he is distanced from his opponent and controlling the main stage: he should use his variety of projectiles to keep opponents at a workable distance to take full advantage of his spectacular range, all while avoiding getting sent offstage due to his poor offstage survivability.

In direct comparison to his Echo Fighter, Richter, who is almost fully identical to him with only one single difference, Simon has seen smaller representation on his own. The two, however, have seen below-average results in the current metagame due to their shared weaknesses."
Kirby,10,3.663,"Kirby is currently ranked 75th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing him in the D- tier and making him the lowest ranking of the perfect-attendance crew. This is roughly similar to his placement in the previous game, where he was ranked 49th out of 54. Kirby possesses fast tilts and low ending lag on his aerials, granting him access to quick and powerful combos, while his back air and dash attack grant him strong KO options. Kirby's relatively small size and low crouch also makes him hard to hit; his crouch especially allows him to avoid most grabs and some attacks. Finally, Kirby's Inhale grants him his opponent's neutral special move, which not only deals more damage than the opponent's, but can also be used to alleviate some of Kirby's weaknesses.

However, Kirby has poor endurance, as his light weight makes him susceptible to early KOs. His poor air and ground speed, as well as a lack of projectiles and ranged attacks, presents a host of problems in neutral and offstage, as Kirby has trouble approaching and fighting those that can outrange him. Finally, Kirby's recovery, though far-reaching, is rather predictable, and his poor air speed and floatiness make Kirby very vulnerable to edgeguarding.

Overall, Kirby's weaknesses undermine some of his strengths. As a result, he has consistently placed near the bottom in terms of competitive representation. Nevertheless, Kirby has still seen success from dedicated mains such as Guilheww, JeJaJeJa, and Konokururu.","Kirby is known for being a small lightweight, being tied for the eighth-lightest character in the game. True to his franchise, Kirby is a slow, yet floaty character. He has the 31st slowest walking speed, 42nd fastest dashing speed, and 43rd slowest initial dash. He also has the 5th slowest air speed, 20th highest air acceleration, 3rd lowest gravity, the 5th lowest falling and fast falling speeds, and above average traction. Due to these statistics, Kirby has difficulty approaching opponents. Kirby's recovery is versatile: despite his slow air speed and low jump height rendering him susceptible to edgeguarding, his five midair jumps, slow falling speed, long vertical airdodge, and Final Cutter's decent distance give him good stalling capabilities and decent safety.","Kirby's greatest strengths are his quick frame data, high combo potential, and the versatility of his moveset. The majority of Kirby's attacks are characterized by speed, with his tilts being among the fastest in the game, while his slowest moves instead boast high power as a trade-off, while still being quite fast for their power. Neutral attack and forward tilt are fast and have decent range, allowing Kirby to quickly distance opponents, with the latter being used for tech chase setups. Up tilt's low knockback and high speed allow it to combo into multiple moves, such as itself, an aerial attack, or an Inhale. Down tilt's low power is compensated by its very fast speed and it launching opponents at the Sakurai angle, which allows it to trip most opponents even over 80%. Should he trip his opponents with it, he can follow up with a variety of attacks, such as a dash attack, grab, or forward smash. Dash attack’s early hit is excellent for whiff punishing and scoring a KO, potentially KOing opponents starting at 90%, while the late hit can set up into an Inhale. His smash attacks have good range, high power, and great speed, making them excellent at scoring a KO. Kirby is also very small, making him hard to hit, and his very low crouch allows him to avoid almost all grabs and several attacks. As a result, Kirby has an excellent ground and defensive game thanks to his quick frame-data and evasive crouch, requiring opponents to be careful when approaching him in neutral.

The usefulness of Kirby's ground game also extends to his grab game. His grabs have short range but are among the fastest in Ultimate, while his pummel's meager damage output is counterbalanced by its very fast speed. His forward throw, unlike most other forward throws in the game, has combo potential, leading into aerial attacks from low to mid percentages. Back throw can be followed up by a back aerial at 0% on certain characters, can KO at high percents, and can send opponents offstage. Up throw is his strongest throw and is able to KO almost all characters around 170%, or even earlier if it lands on a platform. Lastly, while down throw has no combo potential, it is reliable for damage-racking when no other throw can yield better results.

Kirby's aerial game is also notable. Despite his poor air speed, his air acceleration is high and his aerial attacks also have great versatility. Neutral aerial has a long-lasting hitbox, the clean hit is disjointed and relatively strong, very low landing lag, and good coverage, making it a safe landing option. The weak hit of neutral air can combo into his tilts, grab, or even a smash attack. It can also be used as a combo finisher and as a KO move at high percents. Due to the move lasting longer compared to his other aerials, it can safely pressure shields. Forward aerial is Kirby’s most reliable approaching tool. Despite its moderately slow startup, it has disjointed hitboxes on Kirby’s feet, has a long lasting hitbox that can lead to a wall of pain at low percents, the final hit can lead to a KO at high percents, and has very little landing lag, which makes it very safe on shield and hard to punish. Up aerial has good vertical knockback, low landing lag and a fairly quick auto-cancel window, allowing for several potential follow-ups and even opportunities to KO when near the upper blast line. Back aerial has decent range, high knockback on the clean hit, and is Kirby's fastest aerial, making it one of his strongest options overall. Lastly, down aerial has considerable startup, but has multiple hits that drag opponents downward before the final hit meteor smashes them and has low ending lag, making it a deceptively powerful edgeguarding tool as well as a reliable combo starter with follow-ups on grounded opponents.

Kirby's special moves can provide some unique strengths. Inhale is his most notable example; it allows him to either copy the neutral special move of any character he inhales, or spit them out as a weight-dependent projectile. Depending on what character he inhales, the copy ability can give Kirby a move that helps him in matchups to various degrees, such as useful projectiles to counter-camp his opponent (Needle Storm, Charge Shot, Wolf's Blaster), powerful punish options (Giant Punch, Homing Attack), a reflector (Nayru's Love), or other benefits (Monado Arts). In addition, Kirby's version of the opponent's neutral special has a 1.2× damage multiplier. Kirby can also inhale projectiles; smaller projectiles will be swallowed, allowing him to heal himself, while larger ones (such as a fully-charged Charge Shot) can be stored in his mouth and spat out, essentially giving Kirby a reflector. The spat projectiles can be used to punish opponents at mid-range and can launch them away with high knockback. Inhale can also be used to Kirbycide or spit the opponent out offstage, although the opponent can escape by mashing. Hammer Flip is very powerful, especially when fully charged, and Kirby can move and jump while charging. However, its high startup and endlag, along with its short range and Kirby's already-sluggish movement being further slowed when charging, makes it difficult to land outside of a shield break, covering ledge options, or after a jab lock. Final Cutter is his primary means of recovery, granting good vertical distance, as well as a disjoint in front of him during his ascent and descent. It also emits a shockwave projectile upon landing, making it difficult to punish if the opponent is not behind Kirby. Lastly, Stone causes Kirby to turn into an object and ignore up to 25% damage. It is also a strong attack, especially in the air, and can be canceled shortly after Kirby begins his descent, although these benefits are limited by its slow startup and ending lag, and Kirby is still vulnerable to grabs while transformed. It can also be used on the ground, where it has faster startup due to creating a shockwave and it launches at a semi-spike angle.","Kirby's most notable flaw, however, is his poor approach. Characters who have high mobility or who can camp with projectiles can wall out Kirby, such as Mii Gunner and Samus. Kirby's lack of reliable burst options makes his approach in these matchups problematic and sometimes predictable. In addition, characters with long disjointed hitboxes such as Ike can outrange and wall out Kirby since his range is short relative to the cast. Final Cutter's projectile has decent range and moves quickly, but has somewhat slow startup due to it requiring Kirby to perform the entire rising and falling portions of the move beforehand, and he lacks other projectiles outside of spitting inhaled projectiles/opponents, or from a copy ability. This requires conscientious use to avoid punishment. Despite having great air acceleration, Kirby's air speed is also too slow for him to take advantage of it, hindering his aerial approach and recovery despite possessing five midair jumps. Kirby also has several KO moves, but some can be hard to land without a setup due to their short range. Rage further compounds these issues, as Kirby will be launched even further by a high-damage opponent, and his low weight means he will sometimes not survive long enough to take advantage of his own rage.

In addition, Kirby also has poor endurance. While being light and floaty can help him escape combos from other characters, this also means he risks getting KOed earlier. He is also vulnerable to juggling, due to his aforementioned slow falling and air speeds. This imposes as a risk in approaching opponents in the air, while also preventing Kirby's aerials from being used effectively when in a disadvantage state, often forcing him to rely on his jumps, Stone, or neutral aerial to escape and return to the ground or ledge.","Overall, Kirby tends to run hot and cold. He can inflict an impressive amount of damage if he gets close to his opponent thanks to his excellent frame data and potent combo game, but doing so is challenging for him due to his poor approach. As such, Kirby functions well with a bait-and-punish playstyle, although being unprepared for an opponent's approach can be hazardous due to his low survivability."
Mii Swordfighter,10,3.514,"The Mii Swordfighter is currently ranked 76th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing them in the D- tier. This is a slight improvement over their Super Smash Bros. 4 iteration, which was 56th out of 57 on that game's third tier list before ultimately going unranked on the fourth.","The Mii Swordfighter has had their physical attributes reworked to all be relatively average. No longer determinant on the weight given to whatever Mii they're based on, the Mii Swordfighter is now an average-height, mediumweight fighter, weighing the same as Cloud. Their walk and running speed are fairly average, however they have a relatively high air speed and bear the distinction of being the only Mii Fighter who cannot wall jump. Being a Mii Fighter, the Mii Swordfighter's special moves are determinant on the player's choice, as each special move slot can hold one of three available moves. They possess a total of 12 special moves: Gale Strike, Shuriken of Light, and Blurring Blade (Neutral Special), Airborne Assault, Gale Stab, and Chakram (Side Special), Stone Scabbard, Skyward Slash Dash, and Hero's Spin (Up Special), and Blade Counter, Reversal Slash, and Power Thrust (Down Special).
","One of the greatest strengths of the Mii Swordfighter is their extremely versatile and flexible set of specials, some of which are among the strongest moves in the game. Gale Strike and Chakram are fantastic projectiles which excel at distancing opponents, racking up damage, and edgeguarding. Gale Strike is among the Mii Swordfighter's best moves; while slow for a projectile, it does good damage, is an excellent tool to setup kill confirms due to its large hitbox and fixed knockback, and is very potent at ledgetrapping. Landing a Gale Strike allows the Mii Swordfighter to confirm into a multitude of moves such as back aerial, forward aerial, up aerial, Hero's Spin, and Chakram. Hero's Spin in particular is an extremely potent kill option, being able to take stocks as low as around 40% when confirming out of a Gale Strike at the ledge. Chakram is another potent projectile that is good for both initiating and deterring approaches. The smash input version is good for edgeguarding opponents with especially poor recoveries (i.e. Belmonts and Cloud) and the tilt input version allows the Mii Swordfighter to pressure the ledge and confirm into many different moves, providing them with two tools that establish a good defense-oriented playstyle. Along with being one of the few swordfighters that have access to projectiles, the Mii Swordfighter is also the only one that possesses a reflector in the form of Reversal Slash, which allows them to counter campy, projectile-heavy opponents as well. Additionally, Blade Counter, like other counters, can effectively edgeguard those who possess poor recoveries, though it isn't as effective for KO'ing near the side blast lines due to its' extensive vertical knockback. However, this does provide it with consistent KO potential.

Outside of their strong projectiles, the Mii Swordfighter possesses a few of fast and powerful normals. Back and up aerial are both very fast and powerful, the former of which is a strong tool to use for spacing and the latter for anti-airs and racking damage. Forward and neutral aerial both serve as average spacing tools, with forward air's multihits giving Mii Swordfighter several confirms on grounded opponents. Additionally, almost all of the Swordfighter's aerials can easily be comboed into from their down throw, giving the character extremely reliable damage from grabs. This, along with low aerial landing lag (with the exception of down aerial at 18 frames) results in the Mii Swordfighter having an above average aerial game due to most of their aerials being potential combo starters, while their down aerial, despite having weak set knockback, is great for gimping opponents with subpar recoveries alongside neutral and back aerial. The Mii Swordfighter's tilts, with the exception of forward tilt, are quite fast and are pretty reliable sources of damage and combo potential. Swordfighter's jab combo is relatively strong and launches at a very low angle, making it an option at setting up edgeguards and gimps. Their up tilt is generally used for juggling and starting combos at medium percentages, while their forward tilt and down tilt are more geared towards spacing and poking. The former is able to KO at mid-to-high percents near the ledge, making it a decent KO move, while the latter is safe on shield if spaced, can be used repeatedly without much risk, and reliably leads into combos at lower percents, making it another dependable combo starter the Swordfighter has.

Alongside their potent aerials and tilts are a set of powerful smash attacks and specials. While forward and up smash are both relatively laggy, they both boast a considerable amount of KO power and the same can be said for Blurring Blade and Power Thrust, the former which can KO at extremely low percents when fully charged at the edge of Final Destination.

Additionally, the Mii Swordfighter arguably has the best recovery options out of the three Mii Fighters. As in SSB4, Airborne Assault and Gale Stab both boast an incredible amount of horizontal distance while Stone Scabbard provides a high vertical distance. Skyward Slash Dash is a move similar to that of Fire Fox (with a difference being that it is disjointed), allowing the Mii Swordfighter to have both increased distance and a trajectory that can mix up edgeguarding opponents.","However, in spite of the variety of strengths that the Mii Swordfighter has, they are not without their weaknesses. For a swordfighter, they have one of the (if not the) worst disjoints in the game. Many of their swift normals simply have a lack of range in comparison to other swordfighters such as Lucina and Ike. Additionally, as mentioned before, their mobility is also very lackluster compared to other disjoint users given their average dashing/walking and air acceleration speeds, which makes it difficult for them to keep up with faster, rushdown-based characters (i.e. Sonic). While many of their specials have some form of use, there are a few that provide utility that's considered to be overshadowed compared to other specials, such as Gale Stab, which has trouble snapping to the ledge and has limited KO power and damage unless charged; and Blurring Blade, which suffers from being completely unsafe on shield, having to be charged to gain its high power, and not only sacrificing the use of two great projectiles to be used, but also having limited range itself. While Airborne Assault provides great recovery and sports surprising KO power, its ""detection hitbox"" mechanic means it will always lose hitbox trades and sometimes even miss opponents it should have hit, as well as being unsafe on shield, limiting its use to reading defensive options or poor aerial approaches, as well as situationally hitting ledge-hanging characters.

Furthermore, while many of the Mii Swordfighter's normals are good, their smash attacks are all very laggy and have generally poor reach, especially their up smash, which does not have a vacuum effect like that of Link, Samus, or the Mii Gunner while their good normals begin to lose their utility at higher percentages. Down tilt loses its' combo ability at mid percentages and up tilt is a fairly sluggish move against faster opponents. Additionally, their grab game is subpar, though not to the same extent as Cloud. Aside from down throw, the Mii Swordfighter's throws offer mediocre utility, especially their up throw, which deals extremely low knockback and damage and has no true follow ups. Their throws also have mediocre KO power, with their strongest throw being back throw (which doesn't KO at around 180% at the edge of Final Destination). While Gale Strike and Chakram are still very good projectiles, their start and end lag are both substantial in comparison to other projectiles, making them unsafe to use up close, further exacerbating their struggle against faster characters and giving them a rather poor neutral. Lastly, while their recovery can be very flexible, some of them either offer poor distance or are quite linear, such as Stone Scabbard which provides no horizontal distance and poses a great risk of self destructing, and Hero's Spin, which while is a good out of shield option and has a very powerful final hit, exchanges said strengths for very poor distance.","Overall, the Mii Swordfighter is a jack of all trades amalgamation of all weapon based fighters. The ability to mix and match several different special moves adds a unique layer of versatility by allowing several different playstyles for the same basic fighter, making Mii Swordfighter among the most unpredictable to fight against. However, all of the customizable special moves have a fatal flaw to prevent them from being overpowered and/or are an inferior version of a similar move other fighters possess. Mii Swordfighter is capable of walling out opponents, racking up damage, and securing a plethora of different kill confirms. They excel in mid-close range combat and ledgetrapping with the usage of Chakram and Gale Strike and can restrict projectile usage with Reversal Slash. However, they exchange these strengths for a variety of laggy finishers, a subpar grab game and average movement speed. Despite this, their strengths do outweigh their weaknesses and they have a good number of favorable or even matchups. As a result, the Mii Swordfighter has seen a surprisingly high amount of representation and results in tournaments."
Piranha Plant,10,3.402,"Piranha Plant is ranked 77th out of 82 on the current tier list, placing it in the D- tier and making it the lowest ranking DLC character overall. Piranha Plant's most noteworthy attribute is its trapping potential. Ptooie is considered one of the strongest and most versatile projectiles in the game, being able to dish out a lot of damage, cover aerial approaches, be used as a ledgetrapping tool, and even be employed as a defensive deterrent in the event of the opponent interrupting it in close-quarters engagements. Poison Breath can be utilized to pile on immense damage if Piranha Plant manages to lock in the opponent into its area of effect, or to deny the enemy of approach routes that can circumvent damage. Piranha Plant bolsters these strengths with its possession of very fast frame data on the ground, with moves such as its neutral attack, and forward tilt being able to be employed as effective damage dealing pokes. Its fast frame data extends to its grab and up smash, benefitting its KO power, as its up throw also serves as a KO throw. These traits round out to make Piranha Plant a highly defensive powerhouse that can respond to several approaches with effective keep away and anti-air options. It is also classified as a heavyweight, offering it a strong level of endurance, which is also complemented by a long-distanced recovery in the form of Piranhacopter.

Piranha Plant is almost completely undone however by its lack of mobility. Lacking in range across all of its close-quarters attacks to offset its poor grounded and aerial movement, Piranha Plant struggles immensely in mounting an offensive neutral, and its advantage state is highly reliant on circumstantially effective attacks to keep the opponent at bay. Long-Stem Strike grants Piranha Plant more range but its high startup, finicky control and vulnerable hurtbox during its extension phase makes it an inconvenient attack to use in many situations. This is exacerbated by Piranha Plant's moveset lacking in the way of notable synergy; while many of its attacks have decent utility, it has very little in the way of optimal combos or routes to pursue the opponent. Many of its moves and aerials pose high amounts of ending lag, while some such as neutral aerial and up aerial are plagued by awkward hitbox placements. Finally, Piranha Plant's reliance on Ptooie serves as a double-edged sword; as the main cornerstone of its game plan, it is completely invalidated by characters with reflectors, making several matchups highly problematic for the character.

Since its release, Piranha Plant has seen low tournament representation, and although it has seen success from players such as Brood, Lucky, and Tas, it is considered a fairly weak character in competitive play.","Piranha Plant is a heavyweight fighter with below-average mobility and effective anti-air tools. Compared to other heavyweights, it fits in the mold of an archetypal heavyweight: while its dashing speed is average and its gravity is very high, it has a slow walking speed, air acceleration, and air speed, and a fast falling speed.","One of Piranha Plant's most effective strengths is its diverse special moves. Its neutral special, Ptooie, is a unique projectile that can be tossed in either direction or held in the air as a good anti-air option, and a good trading tool due to its power and transcendent priority. Poison Breath is a slow-moving projectile that does not make opponents flinch, but deals massive damage, especially when fully charged; opponents must be very wary of it, making it a good area-denial tool. Its up special, Piranhacopter, has hitboxes beside itself and travels a great distance, pairing well with Piranha Plant's heavy weight and fast falling speed to give it excellent survivability. Its down special, Long-Stem Strike, grants super armor during its pot phase and tremendous range when fully charged, at the cost of extending its hurtbox significantly.

Piranha Plant's ground game is overall rather versatile; its tilts are good for starting juggles or combos, as well as spacing and KOing. Up tilt can lead into various aerial attacks, and a forward smash at low percents; forward tilt behaves similarly to Snake's in that it is a natural combo consisting of two hits, of which the second hit can KO at very high percentages; and down tilt is a versatile combo starter, being capable of leading into moves such as forward tilt or forward aerial at low to mid percentages, and into aerials afterward. Its smash attacks are generally slow but powerful, such as its forward smash, which is somewhat slow in terms of startup and ending lag, but can KO opponents near the ledge as early as 60% if sweetspotted.

Its aerials are overall well-rounded, making its air game overall decent despite its rather sluggish mobility and moves with relatively high landing lag. Neutral aerial is a multi-hit move that functions much like Palutena and Ivysaur's neutral aerials, being a capable combo move with the ability to drag opponents down for combos and potentially makes it a gimping tool due to this trait. Forward aerial is good for edgeguarding thanks to its wide range, whereas back aerial is a slow but very powerful move that KOs at 80% near the ledge. Up aerial is one of its best comboing and juggling tools, thanks to its speed and wide range and can autocancel in short hop. Lastly, down aerial is a long-ranged and decently strong meteor smash with very fast startup.

Another strength Piranha Plant possesses is a decent grab game; while its grab range is short, its grabs' frame data is among the fastest in the game, and its throws have their own unique perks; forward throw is a useful throw for positioning and edgeguarding, back and up throws have KO potential at high percentages, and down throw is a viable combo starter at low to high percentages.","Piranha Plant does, however, have some noteworthy flaws. Its overall mobility is lackluster, having an average initial dash speed and dash speed, but poor air acceleration and slow airspeed. This gives it difficulties keeping up with faster characters such as Zero Suit Samus or Wolf, especially in the air, which makes it rather easy to zone out. Piranha Plant's heavyweight and tall hurtbox makes it vulnerable to combos, particularly from those with strong combo games such as Peach or Mario, and has trouble landing from juggles due to its lack of fast enough tools to escape from them. Finally, Piranha Plant's approach options are rather predictable, with its overall frame data being generally slow. This is no exception to its KOing options either, and most of Piranha Plant's KO moves are either short-ranged or laggy.

Another problem Piranha Plant has is that its two projectiles, which are a crucial part of its toolkit, are notably vulnerable to reflectors due to the slow startup of Ptooie and the fact that Poison Breath can be reflected at any point during its duration, which forces it to use its projectiles more shrewdly when facing opponents with reflectors.","Overall, Piranha Plant is a unique heavyweight fighter that utilizes various projectiles and attacks to effectively zone and KO opponents, but must be careful when throwing out normal attacks to avoid being punished due to the end lag that many of them have, thus making it a patient fighter when it comes to approaching."
Dr. Mario,10,3.394,"Dr. Mario is currently ranked 78th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing him in the lower half of D- tier and making him a bottom five character. Despite being buffed overall, this is a slight drop from his placement in Smash 4, where he was ranked 48th out of 54, and is his worst placement in the series. Dr. Mario's playstyle is effectively a slower yet stronger version of Mario's. As a result, all of his moves possess better KO potential and/or damage output compared to Mario, while he keeps most of Mario's frame data, which allows him to perform short yet effective combos. Dr. Mario's signature projectile in Megavitamin is an effective projectile for approaching and neutral and it also opens up combos and KO confirms at higher percents into most of his moves. In addition, Dr. Mario has several strong yet effective KO options in his arsenals, including Super Jump Punch, Dr. Tornado, most of his aerials, and back throw. This means players have to play more carefully when close to Dr. Mario, as a single whiff could lead into a deadly punish.

However, Dr. Mario's weaknesses outshine many of his strengths. His most notable weakness is his poor mobility, which cripples his neutral game and makes him vulnerable to camping. In addition, as his playstyle largely revolves around him getting close to his opponent, his poor mobility also makes it harder for him to avoid retaliation from opponents, as Dr. Mario's short range means he is vulnerable to moves with long range or disjoints. Finally, Dr. Mario's recovery, while improved, is still one of the worst in the game, as its short range and his slow air mobility makes him vulnerable to gimping.

Overall, Dr. Mario is a character that has good frame data and strong damage output and KO potential, but his sluggish movements cause him to rely more on a bait-and-punish playstyle. Although his representation has remained below average for most of the game's lifespan, he has nonetheless seen success from players such as JaZaR and Tsumusuto.","As a clone of Mario, Dr. Mario is a middleweight that can wall jump. Like his normal self, Dr. Mario also has excellent frame data: when not counting special moves, the overall start-up lag of his normal moveset is very fast. As a result, Dr. Mario is both difficult to punish and very effective at punishing. Although the two share an overwhelming number of identical animations and even the exact same values for certain attributes (weight, falling speed, fast falling speed and gravity), Dr. Mario nevertheless has a number of traits that differ from his normal self. Like Mario, Dr. Mario's height is below-average.","Dr. Mario functions like a stronger, yet slower Mario, owing to the implementation of multipliers to the majority of his moveset and some of his attributes. Most of Dr. Mario's moveset deals 1.176× more damage compared to Mario's moveset. Conversely, his full hop height is 0.85× lower; his walking and dashing speeds are 0.7942× slower; his air speed, air acceleration, short hop height, and double jump height are 0.7648× lower. Most of the multipliers result in Dr. Mario being distinctly affected by passive equipment physics from Super Smash Bros. 4, in which he specifically possesses a +22 Attack value and a -65 Speed value.[1] Although Dr. Mario's lower jump height makes his short hop more effective than Mario's, these modified attributes collectively render his overall mobility as sub-par. His wall jump and ledge jump also cover less distance as a result. Conversely, Dr. Mario's higher overall damage output results in him being noticeably more efficient at KOing in comparison to Mario. His traction is also slightly higher than Mario's, though merely average when compared to the roster.

Other noticeable differences between Dr. Mario and Mario are seen in their movesets and, by extension, their playstyles. Although Dr. Mario's overall frame data is only very slightly slower than Mario's (if even at all), his higher overall damage output and slower overall mobility make him unable to use a healthy balance of offense and defense like his normal self. Instead, Dr. Mario is much better suited to a bait-and-punish playstyle. On a related note, Dr. Mario's combo game is less varied and consistent compared to his normal self's, especially with regard to aerial combos. Despite this, his combos deal respectable damage in spite of their fairly short lengths, similarly to characters like Incineroar.

Dr. Mario's grounded moveset has plenty of utility in spite of his slow speed. Neutral attack is Dr. Mario's fastest attack, and the first two hits can lock opponents. Forward tilt is a great get-off-me option, and possesses situational KO potential at very high percentages unlike Mario's version. Up tilt is a decent anti-air and juggling tool that can KO at very high percentages, and it can also combo into itself, neutral aerial, up aerial, back aerial and Super Jump Punch, but is not as effective as a combo starter as his down tilt; however, the move's horizontal range is shorter than in Smash 4, and its hitboxes start from a higher position, allowing shorter, crouching or prone characters to potentially low-profile the move. Down tilt is one of Dr. Mario's best combo starters; although it is short-ranged, it is very reliable at a wide range of percentages, with its lower knockback scaling compared to Mario's even allowing it to combo at percentages where Mario's would not work, and depending on the percentage, it can lead into neutral attack, forward tilt, up tilt (only on certain characters), itself, up smash (only on certain characters), down smash, neutral aerial, up aerial, back aerial and Super Jump Punch. His dash attack has vertical knockback, allowing it to serve as a combo starter but hindering its edgeguarding potential. His forward smash, while slower than his other smash attacks, is extremely powerful for an attack of its speed, especially if the sweetspot connects; unlike Mario's, it possesses the electric effect, has shorter range, and the sweetspot and sourspot hitboxes are swapped around. Up smash functions more similarly to Luigi's version than to Mario's version, as it launches the opponent diagonally instead of vertically, and will launch them in the opposite direction of where Dr. Mario is facing as long as they are in front of him; compared to Luigi's, however, it launches at a lower angle, and it has lower base knockback than both Mario and Luigi's up smashes. Nevertheless, up smash's launch angle does make it much better at edgeguarding or setting up edgeguards than both Mario and Luigi's versions, and its higher damage output and knockback scaling compared to both of them also makes it a highly lethal KOing option. His down smash is his fastest smash attack, hitting on both sides (with the back hit being stronger than the front hit), and like Mario's version, it is useful for punishing rolls.

Like Mario, Dr. Mario possesses a decent grab game. His overall grab range is average, but each of his grabs have minimal start-up and ending lag. Forward throw is useful for initiating edgeguards; back throw is one of the strongest back throws in the game; up throw is a decent combo starter that can combo into up tilt (certain characters only), up aerial, neutral aerial, back aerial and Super Jump Punch; and down throw is his most effective combo throw, being able to combo into up tilt (certain characters only), up smash (certain characters only), neutral aerial, up aerial, back aerial, Super Jump Punch and Dr. Tornado depending on the opponent's percentage.

Like his normal self, Dr. Mario's air game is above-average. Neutral aerial is a ""reverse sex kick"": its clean hitbox deals minimal damage and knockback, whereas its late hitbox deals more damage. Thanks to it hitting on frame 3 and having low landing lag, its clean hitbox is ideal for set-ups. Conversely, its late hitbox is decent at edgeguarding, due to its long hitbox duration and larger hitbox than the late hit of Mario's equivalent move. Forward aerial has considerable start-up lag, but its clean hitbox makes it one of the strongest aerials in the game; as such, it is lethal when SHFFed against unwary opponents that are near the edge. Back aerial is also fast, auto-cancels in a short hop, and possesses a powerful clean hitbox, traits which collectively make it viable for KOing, edgeguarding and approaching. Up aerial's horizontal launching angle grants its beginning and ending frames decent combo potential into Super Jump Punch and back aerial, respectively, at low to medium percentages. This angle also makes its beginning frames capable of edgeguarding, unlike his normal self's up aerial. However, up aerial's launch angle also makes it much less effective at starting combos when SHFFed or juggling compared to Mario's. His new down aerial, while having slow startup, is a powerful meteor smash, making it an excellent option for edgeguarding; it is also an extremely solid combo starter with an extremely wide range of follow-ups on grounded opponents depending on their percentage, including neutral attack, forward tilt, up tilt, down tilt, dash attack, forward smash, up smash, down smash, grab, all aerial attacks (including itself), Super Jump Punch and Dr. Tornado.

With regard to special moves, Megavitamins travel farther in the air without landing compared to Mario's Fireball, and they bounce twice instead of three times; they also have altered knockback, allowing for a wider range of follow-ups. Super Sheet has more vertical range but less horizontal range than Cape, but its aerial version completely lacks the stalling effect of Mario's version, completely removing its recovery potential; it also has a 1.6× reflection multiplier, making reflecting projectiles with it more rewarding compared to doing so with Mario's Cape.

Unlike F.L.U.D.D., Dr. Tornado is an effective recovery option, with repeated mashing of the special move button allowing Dr. Mario to rise upward with it. It also deals damage. When coupled with its high damage output, very high knockback scaling and autolink angle, it is useful for edge-guarding, warding off edgeguarders, and even out-prioritizing attacks, and it also possesses excellent KO potential. However, Dr. Tornado's much shorter range makes it much riskier to use for edgeguarding compared to F.L.U.D.D. Due to Super Jump Punch consisting of a powerful clean hitbox and a weak late hitbox instead of multiple hitboxes like Mario's, it actually functions more similarly to Ryu's Shoryuken or Marth's Dolphin Slash instead. As a result, its clean hitbox makes it a viable KOing option unlike Mario's. Super Jump Punch is also an extremely effective out of shield option thanks to its frame 3 startup, much like Mario's version.","However, Dr. Mario's flaws are significantly more noticeable in comparison to Mario's. The most prominent one is his lackluster mobility, which hinders his ability to approach opponents, and renders him vulnerable to zoning and circle camping from characters with strong projectile games and high mobility, respectively, similarly to Ganondorf and Incineroar; unlike those two characters, however, Dr. Mario has an effective projectile in Megavitamins, a smaller hurtbox, effective out of shield options, and a decent reflector in Super Sheet, giving him a better defensive game in comparison. Additionally, Dr. Mario shares Mario's notable weakness of having short range in his attacks, which can give him trouble against characters with long or disjointed hitboxes; whereas Mario's faster mobility allows him to somewhat circumvent this weakness, especially against characters with poor mobility and/or frame data, Dr. Mario is less capable of weaving in and out of his opponent's range, making such characters much more difficult for him to deal with. Dr. Mario's sluggish mobility compounds another notorious weakness—his recovery. Despite being able to wall jump and the fact that Dr. Tornado is a much better recovery option than Cape, the combination of his slow air speed, low jump height, slow air acceleration and Super Jump Punch's mediocre travel distance results in his recovery being predictable like Mario's.

Due to his overall recovery granting noticeably less vertical distance compared to Mario's, Dr. Mario is very vulnerable to gimping and edgeguards. As a result, it is optimal for him to read the opponent when trying to return to the stage, as well as knowing when and how to make use of Dr. Tornado, which has a huge amount of ending lag (33 frames, aerial version) and cannot sweetspot edges. Due to his short recovery distance, any sufficiently strong attacks, particularly semi-spikes, may launch him too far away to recover properly. Lastly, Dr. Mario is outclassed in certain aspects by other characters: in particular, Zero Suit Samus has much better overall mobility; Shulk has much more range; and Snake is much better at zoning.","Overall, Dr. Mario's strengths are outweighed by his weaknesses. His fast frame data enables him to pressure, combo and/or punish the opponent effectively at close range, while his above-average damage output makes him capable of KOing easily. Unlike Mario, however, his slow mobility hinders his neutral game so much that he is largely reliant on baiting and punishing. By extension, his sub-par recovery makes him a less capable edgeguarder compared to his normal self, and he retains his normal self's lack of range as well."
King Dedede,11,3.009,"King Dedede is currently ranked 79th out of 82 on the current Ultimate tier list, placing him at the top of E+ tier, and the lowest ranked veteran from Brawl. While Dedede was significantly buffed, this is similar to his exceptionally low placement in Smash 4 at 51st out of 54.

King Dedede has some of the best endurance out of any fighter on the roster. Dedede is tied with Donkey Kong as the third heaviest character in the game and has one of the best vertical recoveries due to Super Dedede Jump, allowing him to survive to extremely high percents. Dedede's primary strengths lie in his hammer and deadly ledge traps. King Dedede's hammer provides him with large, disjointed hitboxes on many of his moves, making him one of the few super-heavyweights that can reliably space his opponent. Dedede's hammer can also be quite powerful, as he boasts some of the strongest smash attacks and aerials in Ultimate. Furthermore, Dedede's Gordo Throw combined with his various tilts and smash attacks can make Dedede one of the most intimidating characters on the ledge. King Dedede's moves were largely buffed in power, frame data, and combo ability in their transition to Ultimate. The most significant buff to Dedede's overall moveset is that Inhale now serves as a reflector, allowing Dedede to better fight against projectile camping. Inhale can also be used in conjunction with his Gordos, giving him another way to use his sole projectile against his opponent.

Changes made to the engine in the transition from Smash 4 to Ultimate have benefited Dedede's limited combo potential and linear recovery. Universal reductions to landing lag made neutral aerial and up aerial better combo tools than in Smash 4. Changes made to jumpsquats and air dodging enhance Dedede's edgeguarding and his poor horizontal recovery options. While air dodging was severely nerfed in Ultimate, Dedede is relatively unaffected by these changes due to his multiple jumps and high vertical recovery.

However, King Dedede has severe flaws that overshadow most of his positive attributes, especially when in disadvantage. Dedede's awful mobility is the source of many of his problems, with him especially struggling in the air thanks to having the slowest air speed in the game. While Dedede's overall speed is better than in Smash 4, it's still a challenge for him to approach or retreat from his opponent. Like many super-heavyweights, King Dedede has a large hitbox and few escape options, making him highly susceptible to combos and juggling. While this can be somewhat dealt with through Dedede's incredibly fast falling speed, his super-heavyweight attributes only compound the issues his sluggishness presents. Dedede's atrocious air speed in combination with his fast fall speed leave him exceedingly vulnerable offstage, making it troublesome for Dedede to get back to stage safely. Despite the universal decrease in lag, the slow frame data associated with Dedede's moves make a majority of his moveset highly committal. Dedede's specials all leave him open to punishment. Inhale and Jet Hammer, despite their newfound uses, still have slow ending lag. Dedede has to be careful when using Gordo Throw, as Gordos can be reflected back by the opponent with any move that does 2% or higher, causing significant damage. Super Dedede Jump is best used if Dedede can connect with the ledge, as the move has exceptionally high ending lag on stage. All of this leads to Dedede having a surprisingly hard time taking off stocks, as his powerful finishers are unsafe, and his deadly set-ups are difficult to establish in neutral.

King Dedede's sheer amount of problems have left him with negative competitive reception. While Dedede was initially viewed as an upper mid tier, his weaknesses only became more apparent as the metagame progressed. Dedede also received notable nerfs to his Gordo hitboxes and shield break set-ups in subsequent balance patches, lowering his competitive standing even further. Though players such as Atomsk and ZAKI have seen some success with the character, many of Dedede's early mains have either dropped him or relegated him to a secondary.","King Dedede is tied for the third heaviest character in the game alongside Donkey Kong, making him a super heavyweight. King Dedede shares some typical attributes with other heavyweights, such as a high damage output, high KO potential, great endurance, quick falling and fast falling speeds (both tied for second and third fastest respectively), overall sluggish mobility, large size and a high susceptibility to combos. In addition to having an average initial dash and the thirtieth highest gravity, he has the twenty-eighth slowest walking speed, eleventh slowest dashing speed, the worst air speed in the game, and the fourth slowest air acceleration. To counteract these flaws, however, King Dedede is gifted with four midair jumps.","As a super-heavyweight, King Dedede has immense endurance, both vertically and horizontally. His massive weight makes him difficult to launch, and his incredibly fast falling speed lets him return to the ground quickly. Despite having the worst air mobility, his four midair jumps and Super Dedede Jump, the latter of which travels a very long vertical distance and has super armor during its ascent and descent, gives him great recovery for a heavyweight. Super Dedede Jump also has a meteor smash hitbox during its descent, making it risky to intercept if he recovers high. His tech rolls are unusually long-distanced for a character of his size, making him difficult to tech-chase. Finally, King Dedede's trademark hammer grants him a long disjoint in many of his attacks, allowing him to safely space his opponents, especially if they are slow and have worse range than him.

True to a super heavyweight character, King Dedede is gifted with an abundance of finishers. King Dedede's dash attack is a notable example, as it deals huge damage, and reliably KOs under 100%, while being able to KO as low as below 60% near the ledge. King Dedede's smash attacks all possess great power, great disjointed range, and transcendent priority, while having their own perks: forward smash can reliably KO from 60% and below in most situations, has deceptively short ending lag for an attack of its power, while also being able to deal severe shield damage; up smash reliably KOs from anywhere on-stage around 100ish% without rage, while covering a large space all-around Dedede; lastly, down smash is his fastest smash attack in his arsenal and covers significant horizontal distance around both sides of Dedede, while easily KOing below 100% near the ledge and around 125% from center.

The rest of King Dedede's grounded moveset comes with merits: neutral attack can be useful for racking up damage, while the finisher's unique vertical knockback allows this move to KO at 150% under rage. King Dedede's forward tilt sports good range and startup lag, while its multiple hits are effective for dealing damage and starting combos, while also trapping rolling or floor-bound opponents; up tilt has quick startup lag and good range, allowing it to combo into itself while dealing good damage and leaving King Dedede's body and head intangible; lastly, down tilt deals good damage and has good range, being able to pursue opponents or retreat from them.

King Dedede's aerial game is also decent, thanks to his multiple midair jumps which allow him to stall and bait reactions from opponents. Neutral air is his fastest aerial due to coming out on frame 7, which can disrupt enemy combos, and its late hit can also set up combos for Dedede himself, such as up tilt or up air. Forward air has a lot of range in front of Dedede, which is good for spacing with its decent startup speed, and can wall of pain at lower percents. Back air is a potent kill option with a good range behind Dedede, which is also a good option for spacing and landing. Up air can beat out a lot of down aerials thanks to its long-range, and it also has strong KO potential. Down air, when sweetspotted, is a powerful meteor smash offstage, but its use in general is limited due to its slow startup and small awkward hitbox.

King Dedede's grab game has perks of its own. Although his grab has merely average range, this problem can be mitigated by dash grabbing. His pummel is good for racking up on damage, due to its quick speed, which is especially deadly at high percentages; forward throw has good edgeguarding potential, being able to follow up with Gordo Toss; back throw is Dedede's strongest throw, dealing the most damage and knockback while having limited degrees of damage racking and edgeguarding potential; up throw can also be used to launch opponents into previously thrown Gordos, and can follow up with an up aerial; lastly, down throw's low damage and knockback lend it great combo potential, easily stringing into itself, and initiating combos with Dedede's neutral, forward, and back aerials.

King Dedede's special moves have decent utility as well. Inhale acts as a strong command grab that can be B-Reversed for landing options against shielding opponents on the ground or on platforms above Dedede. The spit can force opponents into a recovery state by sending them offstage or even spit them under the stage, which is perhaps where Dedede is strongest. Inhale also doubles as a reflector, allowing him to contest against projectile campers. The Gordos from Gordo Throw act as powerful stage control options with KO potential in their own right at 140% and above and can set up deadly ledge traps. Lastly, Jet Hammer is an effective punishing tool with heavy armor that does very high damage and knockback, and with a max charge, it can break full shields.
","In spite of these strengths, King Dedede still has noteworthy drawbacks. King Dedede's biggest problem is his approach, which is among the worst in the game. His mobility is sluggish, especially in the air, giving King Dedede immense difficulty catching up to or retreating from his opponents. King Dedede's below-average dashing speed also makes him over-reliant on fox-trotting to cover grounded distances, which itself is somewhat predictable.

Although King Dedede's fast falling speed allows him to easily return to the ground, his slow air speed, large hurtbox, heavy weight and lack of fast-enough escape options renders him vulnerable to combos and juggling. King Dedede's recovery is further hampered by his aforementioned slow air speed and fast falling speed, often forcing him to use his Super Dedede Jump to return onstage. Super Dedede Jump itself, in spite of traveling high, also causes King Dedede to descend very quickly; this, coupled with its limited horizontal maneuverability, renders Super Dedede Jump unreliable for recovering at certain distances offstage.

King Dedede's other specials can work against him as well. Inhale has high ending lag, allowing other characters to easily punish him after he finishes the move. Gordo Toss's Gordos can be reflected back at King Dedede from any attack that does 2% or higher, dealing immense damage to him and potentially resulting in a self-induced KO, requiring him to exercise caution or utilize Inhale on his reflected Gordos. Jet Hammer also takes a long time to charge, leaving King Dedede susceptible to attack, and its high ending lag leaves him vulnerable to punishment from his opponents.","Overall, King Dedede's high weight, endurance, range, and power allow him to punish his opponents with relative ease and survive for a very long time, but his poor overall mobility makes King Dedede's approach somewhat abysmal and renders his recovery somewhat predictable and overly reliant on Super Dedede Jump. Dedede players should be careful to not make a mistake, or else they might potentially risk getting heavily punished."
King K. Rool,11,2.877,"King K. Rool is currently ranked 80th out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, in the middle of E+ tier, making him the lowest ranked newcomer. Typical for a super-heavyweight character, King K. Rool possesses a wide arsenal of very powerful, hard hitting attacks, with many of them also having great range. King K. Rool also boasts some of the best endurance in the game - he is the second heaviest character behind Bowser, which in combination of his unique character-specific perk, Belly Super Armor, high falling speed, and a very long-distanced recovery thanks to Propellerpack, allows him to survive to ludicrously high percentages and utilize rage very well, especially with his aforementioned powerful attacks.

In addition, King K. Rool has a unique and rather versatile moveset. Some of his attacks, such as his neutral attack, up tilt, up smash and up aerial, all have disproportionately quick startup in comparison to other super-heavyweight characters. King K. Rool also has two projectiles, Blunderbuss and Crownerang, with the former also functioning as a command grab and the latter having damage-based armor, while his down special, Gut Check, functions as a both counter and reflector. These moves alongside Belly Super Armor grant K. Rool unique anti-zoning tools atypical for his weight class. King K. Rool has interesting utility with many of his normals as well - down tilt can bury his opponents, neutral aerial is an excellent landing - and edgeguarding tool thanks to Belly Super Armor and long-lasting, lingering hitbox, forward aerial has a combination of great power, reach and safety due to relatively low landing lag, up aerial gives a slight vertical momentum and is disproportionately powerful, and back aerial is a very powerful meteor smash. Finally, King K. Rool has an excellent grab game, all of his grabs have very far reach and he possesses arguably one of the best set of throws in the game, with two of them having great KO potential (up and back throws), one functioning as a burying throw that can setup for KOs (down throw), and one with combo potential at low percentages (forward throw).

However, for his many strengths, King K. Rool has several weaknesses. His tall, rotund hurtbox is among the largest in the game, which combined with his gargantuan weight and high falling speed makes King K. Rool very easy to combo. King K. Rool's mobility also leaves a lot to be desired - while his initial dash speed is above average, his actual run speed is poor, and his air speed is also below average. While King K. Rool has relatively fast startup on many of his attacks, a few of them (down tilt, forward smash, down smash and back air) are nevertheless somewhat slow, and almost all of his attacks suffer from a universal flaw - extreme ending lag. Because of the latter, King K. Rool is very susceptible to being whiff punished, while having very few attacks that are safe on shield. The ending lag issue is especially prominent with King K. Rool's aerials - all of his aerials other than his neutral aerial suffer from disproportionately high ending lag, with all of them having total duration of at least 54 frames. This somewhat restricts King K. Rool's air game, as most of his aerials are very punishable if not performed right before landing.

Many of King K. Rool's own unique attributes have flaws attached to them. Belly Super Armor only protects his belly and can break akin to a shield break if it takes too much damage. Similarly, Gut Check only protects King K. Rool's belly, making his head and back vulnerable. While Propellerpack grants him a long-ranged recovery, it is slow, very linear, and only protects King K. Rool from above, making his recovery predictable and very exploitable. Crownerang's armor does not protect against strong attacks or grabs, and the crown can also be picked up as an item by other characters. King K. Rool also has very lackluster out of shield options - while his up smash is fast, the initial hit only hits above K. Rool and is very punishable, while his second fastest option, neutral aerial, has a short range, especially behind him. This is further made worse by the fact that King K. Rool is forced to shield relatively often due to his massive hurtbox and below-average mobility. Finally, because of his massive size and limited ledge options, King K. Rool is very susceptible to being ledgetrapped.

While King K. Rool is a fairly popular character in lower level and casual play, his high-level representation is quite limited due to his significant flaws and a small playerbase. However, thanks to efforts of dedicated players such as Ben Gold, Raphy, and most notably, KirbyKid, and significant buffs via game updates, King K. Rool has nevertheless gathered a couple of decent results during Ultimate's lifespan, in spite of his aforementioned issues and low placement on the tier list.","King K. Rool is a character that ostensibly fits the mold of a super heavyweight, being the 2nd heaviest character in the game behind Bowser and possessing a large array of powerful attacks with long range, but with below-average mobility; while his falling speed and gravity are noticeably above average, his traction and jumping force are average at best, and he also has the 20th slowest air speed, the 17th slowest walking speed, the 13th slowest dashing speed, and the 8th slowest air acceleration in the game.","Despite this, King K. Rool's initial dash has above-average speed, which gives him a great dash dance and foxtrot, the latter of which partially alleviates his sluggish grounded mobility. However, he has some characteristics that notably set him apart from his heavyweight peers; he has a wide variety of versatile moves, access to two conventional projectiles, a long-distanced recovery, and other valuable techniques that aid his playstyle in regard to focusing on punishing mistakes and zoning against horizontal approaches.

King K. Rool's greatest strength is the immense utility of his moveset. Though many of his attacks are typical of super-heavyweights, he also has attacks that exchange brute strength (though most of them are still powerful) for unique attributes that contribute to his punish-focused playstyle. This is best shown through his character-specific perk, Belly Super Armor: attacks with this property gain short periods of this super armor, which can block incoming attacks during their duration. This mechanic gives him an advantage that allows him to win more exchanges than he would normally. Additionally, it affects a large amount of his moves, granting more safety on moves such as his forward tilt and dash attack to break through projectiles or difficult to punish attacks. As a result, Belly Super Armor heavily helps his approach and general disadvantage.

Alongside the utility of his Belly Super Armor, King K. Rool has effective grounded attacks. His neutral attack has good range and high speed, making it reliable as a quick get-off-me option. It is also tied with Incineroar, Ike, and Wario's neutral attacks as the third most damaging non-infinite neutral attack in the game, and leads into a tech situation at low to mid percentages. His tilts are very effective; for example, up tilt comes out very quickly, deals respectable damage and knockback during its initial frames, and has enough range to hit platforms above K. Rool while also being slightly disjointed due to his punching arm being intangible for its duration. This can also be used to anti-air or prevent approaches from characters such as Lucina and Roy. It is also the most reliable move out of down throw, becoming a true combo from around 120% and reliably KOing most characters at such percents if near the ledge.

Down tilt can bury grounded opponents or KO airborne ones, making it a potent punishment option. It also works at the ledge as a ledgehang punish or 2-frame option, and has a large shockwave hitbox that notably extends its range. His aforementioned forward tilt grants him Belly Super Armor as early as frame 5, has excellent range, can be angled up or down (with latter capable of being used as a ledge hang punish or 2-frame option), and is among the most powerful of its kind. Finally, his dash attack is also equipped with Belly Super Armor, has fast startup, a long-lasting, large hitbox, and is exceptionally strong, being a very potent, powerful burst option that can go through variety of attacks.

All of his smash attacks are incredibly powerful, and coupled with their unique traits and the belly armor on his up and down smashes, allow for very effective punishment. Forward smash deals heavy knockback regardless of where it hits, especially if angled upwards. It also confirms out of a down tilt bury at 70%, KOing the opponent provided they are not too far from the ledge. Up smash functions as a quick anti-air, is extremely strong for its speed, and also has a small meteor smash hitbox in addition to a third hitbox that punishes grounded foes. However, only the first is really useful as the other two are weak and largely ineffectual. Down smash deals massive shield damage and lifts K. Rool's entire body off the stage from frame 4, allowing it to dodge most ground-hugging moves and makes it his best hard punish option considering its immense strength. Overall, his smash attacks are all formidable for hard punishes. Both up and down smash are equipped with Belly Super Armor, which is especially useful in the case of down smash as it allows it to punish more attacks than similar moves such as Ridley and Incineroar's respective down smashes could.

His aerials are also fairly unique in their utility. Neutral aerial grants the longest duration of belly armor in K. Rool's moveset, making it a reliable combo breaker or landing tool to prevent juggling. Neutral aerial also has very low landing lag, allowing it to combo into moves such as neutral attack, up tilt, dash grab, and dash attack, the latter in particular being a KO confirm at certain percentages. The move's long-lasting, lingering hitbox and Belly Super Armor makes it a very effective edgeguarding tool, as it can negate a variety of recovery moves and gimp most opponents with ease. King K. Rool's forward aerial is arguably his best move overall, being a cornerstone for his neutral game. It has amazing range, hits exceptionally hard, and because of its low landing lag, it is safe on shield and is his best combo starter at low percentages. This gives the move a extreme utility as a neutral tool, KO move, combo starter, decent air-to-air option against some characters, as a potent albeit situational edgeguard option, for catching jumps and even as an occasional punish out of his burying moves. Forward aerial also deals non-tumble hitstun at 0%, allowing him to confirm into a grab.

Up aerial is a very unorthodox move with a surprisingly high amount of utility. It has quick start-up, a very long-lasting hitbox, and excellent KO power, while also working as a good platform movement out of a short hop. This is most effective when platforms are low, such as on Battlefield; it can also be used as a situational third jump while recovering, stalling K. Rool in the air while allowing it to potentially cancel out projectiles thrown at him. Because of the Belly Super Armor, long-lasting hitbox and the fact that K. Rool does not perform the slight jump while in hitstun, it can be used as a situational combo breaker. Down aerial and back aerial are meteor smashes, with the former coming out relatively fast and being a potent combo starter and 2-frame punish, and while the latter is very slow, it is also one of the strongest meteor smashes in the game. King K. Rool's back aerial also creates a wall of hitboxes behind him as a sourspot (which is also extremely powerful and can KO as early as 75%) covers his entire arm. His up and down aerials utilize belly armor, but their utility is situational due to their hitboxes being separated from K. Rool's belly. His neutral, forward, and back aerials are also relatively safe on shield, which is unusual for a super-heavyweight character. All in all, each of King K. Rool's aerials possess respectable utility and are overall considered to be his best moves.

His special moves have a wide array of uses as well, with several efficient projectiles; the Blunderbuss is useful for edgeguarding purposes (such as forcing a situation where the opponent has to recover low, allowing for a down aerial) and throws out a Kannonball that can be sucked back in and aimed in a few directions. The Blunderbuss can also act as a command grab, sucking in opponents and shooting them out in different directions, with the forward reshoot in particular sporting very high knockback. The suction of the Blunderbuss is an effective ledge-trapping tool, especially on stages with platforms. Since K. Rool can drop through platforms while still having slight control over his movement, he can limit the opponent's options to effectively escape the ledge.

The vacuum animation can also be delayed and is very quick to come out if a Kannonball is in play, allowing King K. Rool to easily mix up the timings. Crownerang is a very versatile tool that covers a large distance and grants him damage-based armor throughout the majority of its duration, and the late hit can set up combos or even straight up confirm kills into numerous moves. It has high priority that beats out most projectiles, and the armor allows K. Rool to tank numerous attacks, making the move very threatening in some matchups. The pick-up animation also has some ways to be canceled, which can be adapted into the player's gameplan.

Furthermore, King K. Rool has immense durability: between his extreme weight, above-average falling speed, his Belly Super Armor on various moves, and his heavy armor on Crownerang, King K. Rool has some of, if not the best longevity in the game; it is not uncommon for him to sustain more than 200% damage. Additionally, his up special move, Propellerpack, travels a remarkable distance for a heavyweight and is infamously hard to intercept vertically due to its respectably disjointed hitbox. This can be used to poke opponents on the ledge, then jump up with a forward or up aerial to regain advantage. It can also situationally be used to catch opponents near the ceiling to steal a stock, most notably on high recovery routes.

King K. Rool also has one of the best grab games among the entire cast. Each of his grabs have very long ranges and 3 active frames, while his throws boast a mix of high damage outputs and/or respecttable utility. King K. Rool's up throw is almost identical to Incineroar's equivalent throw aesthetically, but is somewhat different mechanically: it involves him jumping toward the upper blast zone quickly and, as a result, can result in him landing on a platform after he descends. It is the most damaging throw in the entire game, dealing almost 20% if the 1v1 multiplier is enabled, making it a very effective damage racking tool. It also leaves the opponent in a juggling situation. It is also one of the strongest up throws in the game, and with help of platforms it can KO even earlier. King K. Rool's back throw is a similarly powerful throw with fantastic KO potential near the ledge, which becomes even more potent with rage. It also sends the opponent at a semi-spike angle, setting up for potentially deadly edgeguards even when it fails to KO.

At higher percentages, King K. Rool's notorious down throw can lead into various mixups with tilts, up smash or aerials depending on the opponent's mash speed. Most notably, he can create a 50/50 situation at around 80%-100% with the throw - up smash covers mashing, allowing him to hit the opponent before they mash out and net a KO, or if they decide not to mash, forward smash will KO them. In addition to this, dash attack or up tilt are reliable options at higher percentages, allowing K. Rool to straight up KO with the throw starting from 120%-140%. Forward throw does decent damage, can help put an opponent offstage and in a disadvantageous position, and leads into a dash attack for a true combo until around 20%. Once this is out of range, it is great for setting up edgeguards. With all of this, K. Rool is always able to deal significant damage if he lands a grab, and is able to KO with his throws earlier than almost every character in the game to the point where he gets a huge chunk of his KOs with his grabs. All of this is made even more effective with his excellent grab range; combined with his effective initial dash, this can allow for a string of grabs that strongly deters shielding.

King K. Rool has access to a large amount of advanced techniques. These techniques assist with movement, mixups, and even enable combos. As a result, he is a rather technical fighter that can be rewarding to a player looking for a simple character with a high learning curve. They are all somewhat practical and reward creative use, allowing players to build interesting playstyles of their own. This makes him easily accessed at a low level, while still being usable on a higher level of play. As long as the player is aware of the options that the design of these techs provide, King K. Rool will reward them for it.","However, King K. Rool's numerous advantages are also met with several weaknesses. His below-average mobility spells trouble for him in certain matchups, and can make him easier to zone. Blunderbuss Kannonballs are slow to set up, and while they can occupy space well, fast characters can easily ignore it if they are even remotely close to him. Crownerang is also somewhat slow, although the crown is a fairly powerful item that opponents can use to rack up damage very quickly. Gut Check is generally inferior to other counterattacks due to having a hitbox only on his stomach, while having significantly higher endlag than most reflectors (around 30 frames if it fails), making it unreliable. This endlag makes it almost meaningless against some projectiles, such as Mega Man's neutral attack.

King K. Rool's extreme weight, very large hurtbox, and above-average falling speed make him seriously vulnerable to combos, and while his Belly Super Armor can help alleviate this, it's not completely foolproof: if K. Rool takes 36.02% of total damage to his armor over a short period of time, he will suffer a pseudo-shield break and be rendered immobile until his belly armor recovers. It also replenishes only 0.3% per second, making abuse quite difficult. Its limited HP punishes abuse of this mechanic if used frequently. Although it is hard to break in most matchups, it is certainly possible especially against other heavyweights with strong attacks, such as Bowser and Ganondorf.

However, its effectiveness varies depending on whether clashing against his attacks is actually worthwhile. The HP system of Belly Armor makes it quite exploitable and can occasionally act as a liability for survival, forcing him to rely more on non-armored moves when it's about to break. Additionally, due to their brief duration, his belly armor attacks are more reliable on quick, single-hit moves than long, multi-hitting attacks. The utility of Belly Super Armor as a combo breaker is also limited by its relative slowness to come out, being active from frame 6 on neutral and up aerial. K. Rool's other options to escape combos in the air are similarly limited; his air dodge is slower than most of the cast, starting at frame 4, and Gut Check, which also makes him intangible at frame 4 and can heavily punish reckless opponents, is in turn very vulnerable to staggered pressure, especially when used carelessly.

Though a lot of King K. Rool's moves have decent start-up, especially for a super heavyweight, an equal amount of them suffer from very high ending lag, which means that King K. Rool gets easily punished if he fails to connect his attacks. Despite the wide array of tools he has at his disposal, he lacks many moves that can simply be thrown out quickly, as many of his attacks are punishable or force him to use up his belly armor. This ironically makes his approach ineffective despite the sheer amount of different, fast attacks he has; few of his attacks can maintain pressure without being exploited, and the lag can make moves like forward tilt a neutral reset at best. King K. Rool is also vulnerable to being pressured and rushed down due to a poor out-of-shield game; his up smash cannot be used out of shield in most matchups, as the headbutt (which comes out on frame 6) only hits directly above him, while the later plank hitboxes are weak and slow to come out and he is wide open if it's shielded.

King K. Rool's neutral aerial, his fastest and most reliable out of shield option, has poor range, especially behind him, only covering his belly, and is unsafe on hit at low percents. As a result, K. Rool is particularly vulnerable to characters that can cross-up his shield easily, since he effectively has no option to punish this kind of approach and has to resort to retreating or jumping away. Finally, even his amazing grab game has some flaws, mainly due to the low knockback scaling of his throws: forward throw is unable to KO at realistic percentages, up throw requires platforms to KO effectively and is too laggy to have true followups, back throw loses a lot of its KO power if used center-stage due to its low knockback growth, and down throw's extensive mixups and KO confirms more often than not require reads to be effective. It is also affected by the bounce glitch, which adds even more inconsistency to the move.

Additionally, King K. Rool's air game can overall be seen as mediocre. Although his aerials are generally very potent moves and have interesting attributes, including two meteor smashes and armor on some of them, all of these moves (apart from his neutral aerial) suffer from one fatal flaw—very high ending lag in the air—making many of them somewhat situational, and forcing K. Rool to land with the moves to minimize the ending lag in the air. His down aerial's meteor smash hitbox only lasts for two frames and the move itself has high ending lag, making the potential punishes off of it very situational. His up aerial has extreme ending lag (the highest of any aerial in the game), preventing King K. Rool from acting even after a jump (though platforms can alleviate this), making it somewhat risky to use high up in the air. While his back aerial is very strong and has a lingering hitbox, it has very high start-up lag, which makes it easy to stuff out especially with its lack of armor or intangibility, and it additionally has a very weak sourspot that doesn't KO at reasonable percents, making it somewhat inconsistent.

Additionally, none of King K. Rool's aerials autocancel in a short hop. His forward and back aerials require a full hop double jump to autocancel, while up aerial does not autocancel without being very high up. The high ending lag of his aerials makes fast-falling them offstage extremely risky, as it is possible to self-destruct before even getting a chance to recover, which depletes edgeguarding options. Due to the high overall lag of his aerials, K. Rool is unable to juggle for extended periods of time, and his aerial game is mostly constrained to a reactive playstyle. K. Rool's slow aerial mobility further hampers his aerial capacity, and his massive hurtbox makes him a very easy target if in the air, giving him a limited air game, making his playstyle generally more grounded.

Crownerang, while a very strong move on its own, is flawed in many ways. If an opponent picks up the crown after it has been thrown, it leaves him without one of his best tools. The crown can actually be used to edgeguard against Propellerpack, or it can be thrown up to keep it from respawning. It is also very possible for opponents to combo with the crown, or pick it up again after throwing it, with very little counterplay available. The player must adopt an entirely different playstyle while the crown is on the field, or else risk losing a stock. As the pick-up animation takes 17 frames to complete, this also means that it can interrupt crucial combos, leading to the opponent getting away and resetting to neutral. While this is alleviated slightly through tech, it does not help a lot.

King K. Rool's recovery, while effective in theory, is very exploitable by the majority of the roster. Propellerpack is very linear, and a knowledgeable player can edgeguard him for long periods of time. It is immensely slow, and moving around with it reduces the vertical speed and leaves strong momentum, which can lead to a self-destruct if not accounted for. The hitbox does not cover him horizontally at all, and as he cannot cancel the animation, he always has to commit to it. He is usually forced to recover low, which is extremely dangerous due to how many characters have their own unique ways to beat out Propellerpack. Characters such as Piranha Plant and Villager have moves (Ptooie and forward smash respectively in this case) that can also counteract the vertical hitbox.

Propellerpack also leaves him very vulnerable to stage spikes, though LSI greatly alleviates this and allows him to tech to unreasonable percentages. The move can be angled to try and prevent this, though K. Rool usually will not recover without taking a large amount of damage. K. Rool also has very few ledge options; his only unique one is forward aerial, which requires frame-perfect precision to ledgesnap. Other than this, his ledge options are very limited—even Crownerang is too laggy to be used from the ledge reliably—and thus many characters can keep him there for a long time before finally KOing him.","All in all, King K. Rool has a somewhat hard time compensating his heavy drawbacks, even though his strengths are also very potent. King K. Rool is an extremely resilient character that excels at keeping opponents out while punishing mistakes extremely hard. He enjoys playing a unique bait-and-switch playstyle, being a zoner that can switch to aggression whenever there is an opening and net a substantial punish. His damage output cannot be understated, with him often either getting a stock or leaving an opponent at KO percents. This ability to force reactions from his foe makes him unlike any other character in the cast, and creativity rewards the player with a decently versatile character.

However, just like how he capitalizes heavily on mistakes and confusion, King K. Rool's own openings can be heavily punished as well, requiring him to play patiently. To use the full potential of his moveset, the player needs to balance their gameplay between zoning and up and personal aggression. For while K. Rool does have the advantage of switching between safe distancing via Crownerang and the Blunderbuss or pressuring lighter characters with his strong melee attacks, he does not perform well enough to use one strategy alone.

Historically, K. Rool's competitive reception has generally been very negative, though it has somewhat fluctuated over time. Early on, he was considered to be a potential high tier or even top tier character, as well as ""broken"" (especially by casual players), it did not take too long for many top professionals to consider King K. Rool as one of the worst characters in the game due to his severe, heavily exploitable downsides. In Japan, his reputation was even worse, with many top professional players there universally ranking him as the single worst character in the game. This is reflected in his tournament results, as they are very limited in North America and Japan (in latter, practically completely nonexistent outside of online tournaments), especially on the national level.

However, thanks to dedicated players like Ben Gold and Raphy, King K. Rool's results in Australia and Europe respectively are significantly better. Ben Gold in particular managed to win Battle Arena Melbourne 11, the biggest Ultimate major so far in Australia. Although his competitive viability still remains questionable and many players still view him as a low tier or even bottom tier character, the plehtora of significant buffs he received from game updates has made numerous top professional players question whether K. Rool really is as bad as previously thought. Some of them even believe that he might be a mid tier character instead of a low tier or bottom tier character as previously thought. However, how much these buffs have actually affected his viability remains to be seen."
Little Mac,11,2.275,"Little Mac is ranked 81st out of 82 on the Ultimate tier list, placing him at the bottom of the E+ tier, and also being ranked as the second-worst character in the game, only ranking higher than Ganondorf. This is a noticeable drop from his Smash 4 iteration, where he was ranked 43rd out of 54 at the lower end of mid-tier. Little Mac possesses a strong ground game thanks to his excellent ground mobility and numerous grounded kill moves. His smash attacks are especially strong as they have super armor on startup and very respectable speed for their power, making them decently unchallengeable. His tilt attacks are also very respectable, as forward tilt serves as a quick and capable kill move, while down and up tilts can be used to set up combos. Finally, his special moves have also seen improvements from the previous game, most notably to Jolt Haymaker, which no longer sends Little Mac into freefall.

To compensate for his strong ground game, however, Little Mac packs glaring weaknesses, the most notable one being his virtually non-existing aerial game. Although his recovery is improved from the previous game, it remains one of the worst among the roster due to his low double-jump height, being allowed only one Jolt Haymaker per airtime, and Rising Uppercut's pitiful travel distance in the air. His aerial game is also poor due to his aerial's poor damage and knockback as well as his special moves being weaker in the air. Finally, his average stature compared to the rest of the cast and lack of disjoints give him a notable range problem, which, when combined with his low overall shieldstun outside of down-angled forward smash and sweetspotted up smash, force him to play a linear, risky neutral game, while his high fall speed contributes to his vulnerability to combos, despite granting him decent survivability for a lightweight fighter.

Due to Little Mac's extremely polarized nature, he is considered a rather unpopular pick in the current metagame. Despite that, he has still garnered respectable results thanks to the efforts of players such as Peanut and Tarakotori.","Little Mac offers a simple, yet polarized fighting style, performing well on the ground, but poorly in the air. While Mac is rather small in relation to the majority of realistically proportioned characters, he is of average size among the entire cast. This can make him somewhat difficult to hit, but also means that most of his moves have short range, which makes spacing crucial for avoiding punishment.","Little Mac is a lightweight with very impressive ground mobility: he has the 8th fastest walking speed, the 3rd fastest dashing speed, and above-average traction, granting him effective out of shield options. He also has the 3rd fastest initial dash, which has a long duration of 15 frames, giving him a long pivot and an excellent dash dance that is surpassed only by Zero Suit Samus and Mythra. His sidestep and rolls are tied with Fox, Sheik and Zero Suit Samus' for the fastest in the game, with his rolls giving the third longest distance in the game behind Samus and Dark Samus. These stats overall translate to him having excellent ground coverage and makes it easy for Little Mac to keep up with and punish opponents contesting with him on the ground, while also giving him fast and effective grounded defensive options. He also has fast falling speed (tied with King Dedede for the 2nd fastest) and below-average gravity, which collectively give him good vertical endurance in spite of his status as a lightweight. Aside from his great air speed (tied with Mario, Donkey Kong, Sonic and Inkling's for 13th fastest) and his wall jump, which is the 4th highest, the rest of Little Mac's aerial attributes are notoriously poor: his jump is tied with Ryu and Ken's for the 5th lowest, his double jump is the 3rd lowest, his air acceleration is tied with Ganondorf for the 6th lowest, and his directional air dodge travels the least amount of distance. These attributes effectively force Mac to stay on the ground as often as possible to make the use of his excellent ground mobility.

Little Mac's greatest strength is his potent ground game. None of his grounded moves have more than 15 frames of start-up, whereas only his up smash has more than 30 frames of ending lag. Only five non-special moves (forward smash, back air, up smash, down smash and forward air) become active after frame 9, and only the former two after frame 10. His neutral attack, in particular, is tied with Zero Suit Samus' for the fastest move in the game, activating on frame 1 and its minimal ending lag and angles allow it to not only jab lock but also make it and Mr. Game & Watch's neutral attack the only ones in Ultimate that are capable of jab canceling reliably. Despite his somewhat light weight, Little Mac boasts superb KO potential: his forward tilt, dash attack and smash attacks boast high damage outputs and knockback scaling, yet are also fairly fast. Forward smash can be angled, with the downward variant dealing immense shield damage and the upward variant being one of Mac's most effective vertical KO options on the ground. Up smash's coverage allows it to serve as an effective anti-air, and its sweet spot also deals a lot of shield damage. Finally, down smash is a semi-spike with a fairly long range, allowing it to tech chase as well as edge-guard easily against careless or vulnerable recoveries. Besides their speed and strength, Little Mac's grounded moves are also difficult to interrupt, which combined with his high dashing speed gives him an excellent punish game. His tilt attacks boast anti-rebounding priority; this prevents them from clanking with opposing ground attacks provided they're within priority range, allowing Mac to punish opponents very quickly due to his own attacks' high speed. While his smash attacks have normal priority, they instead boast super armor during their use. This offers Mac a unique way of punishing attacks by tanking the hit while immediately retaliating - meaning devastating attacks such as most forward smashes can all be punished. These traits make him arguably the most difficult opponent to directly challenge on the ground for every other character in the roster, including himself.

Little Mac's special moves also have fair utility. Straight Lunge gains distance and power as it charges, deals heavy damage, and boasts light damage-based armor while charging, allowing him to withstand weak attacks before retaliating immediately afterward. As such, it is an effective tool against most infinites and multi-hit moves even while uncharged. The move can also be canceled by shielding, giving it utility for escaping certain combo moves such as Witch Twist, and it can be turned around when released, offering decent mix-up potential and a way to get out of combos. However, Straight Lunge's considerable ending lag limits its offensive utility as it can be easily intercepted or punished, while its defensive utility depends on the character and the attack. This makes it great defensively against characters with low damage output or with reliance on multi-hits, such as Sheik or Meta Knight, but it won't help against opponents with high damage output or on single-hit aerials. Jolt Haymaker propels Mac forward with a leaping punch that travels a fair distance, can be unleashed on command, grants brief intangibility during start-up, and does not lose power when used in mid-air. This makes it useful for tech-chasing, repositioning, and escaping or punishing laggy moves or projectiles, and making it Mac's only useful KO option while in the air and off-stage. Its hitbox is tall enough that it can often clip low-hanging platforms, and catch opponents who are attempting to platform camp him. Unlike in SSB4, it also does not render him helpless, making it a much less dangerous recovery move. Rising Uppercut grants brief intangibility on start-up and travels fairly high when used on the ground. This makes the move an effective combo breaker; combined with the last hit's high knockback scaling, it has a very fast startup and the fact that it doesn't lose power in the air, is also quite potent out of shield and for scoring aerial KOs. Slip Counter is an extremely fast counterattack, making it useful for escaping pressure, especially aerial combos. It is also one of the few counters that slides forward before attacking, allowing Little Mac to get closer to his opponent, or even recover horizontally in response to an edge-guard attempt.

Rounding out his specials, Little Mac has a unique fighter ability called the Power Meter. Displayed over his damage meter, the Power Meter fully charges by dealing 333% or receiving 100%. When fully charged, Straight Lunge is replaced by the KO Uppercut, which can KO any character before 40%. KO Uppercut is also unblockable (barring Witch Time), boasts fast startup, and leaps slightly into the air (allowing it to catch opponents on low platforms such as Battlefield's); combined with its immense power, this can quickly turn the tide of a match or further secure a lead if used successfully. It can be comboed into from down tilt at low percents, and is the ideal tech chase option for a defensive player who tends to roll away from Little Mac when placed under pressure. However, Mac loses the KO Uppercut if tumbled after a 4 second grace period (not including footstool jumping), forcing him to use the move quickly. KO Uppercut also has considerable end lag regardless of whether it hits or not, and its short leap can cause Mac to fall off the stage if used while next to an edge, almost guaranteeing an accidental self destruct if not reacted to. As a result, it is inarguably one of the riskiest, yet most rewarding attacks in the entire series.","While considerably weaker than the rest of the cast, Little Mac's air game is not completely useless and have limited perks, which can be utilized for initiating short combos. Neutral aerial is by far Little Mac's most effective aerial: it is the fastest aerial attack in the game and can be spammed, making it a decent combo breaker or to interrupt opponents when jumping from ledge. It can combo into itself, drag down opponents with him as a sacrificial K.O. option, and grant niche combo opportunities into other aerials or Rising Uppercut. It also features a slightly disjointed hitbox in Mac's pelvis, which causes weak upward knockback that is surprisingly excellent for combos thanks to the move's autocancel properties, which will allow it to combo into up tilt, up aerial, or Rising Uppercut. Forward aerial is a semi-spike and is decent for combos or edge-guarding, especially against poor recoveries; it can also initiate combos into Jolt Haymaker offstage as a powerful sacrificial KO. Up aerial is very fast and can autocancel in a full hop, allowing it to combo into moves like Rising Uppercut when landing. Back aerial is the worst of its kind in the game, but is a semi-spike, has fair spacing utility, and sets the opponent up for tech chase situations when used close to the ground. Finally, down aerial is an extremely fast, weak meteor smash that is mainly useful for locking floored opponents who miss a tech, which opens up devastating punishes courtesy of Little Mac's variety of grounded KO moves. It also acts as a highly situational meteor smash, although it is unlikely to be useful outside of surprise gimping. However, his aerials all have short range, poor damage output, and awful KO potential. While his neutral and down aerials can auto-cancel from a short hop, his forward, back, and up aerials cannot. This leaves Mac incredibly vulnerable in the air, as he has no means of properly defending himself beyond point-blank range without exhausting any of his special moves, which are limited to one use until he touches the ground. The low power of his aerials also makes them ineffective for flinching opponents, and Mac's only aerial KO options are indeed his special moves, which are highly likely to result in sacrificial KOs if misused off-stage. This also means that Mac is more severely affected by stale-move negation than most other characters, as he is effectively limited to using little more than half of his moveset in most situations, although his variety of powerful finishers can compensate it to a degree.

Little Mac sports a mediocre grab game; Mac's pummel is among the fastest, but his grabs, while having average range, have moderate startup lag and noticeable ending lag, and the ending lag and collateral hitboxes for his throws limit their ability to KO or start combos. However, they do have some uses: forward throw can followed into Jolt Haymaker from 0%, but requires a read due to the ending lag; down throw can combo into Rising Uppercut, but has some ending lag and is susceptible to DI; his back throw has decent power and can KO at around 130%, but its collateral hitbox weakens it; up throw can combo into Jolt Haymaker at low to mid percents, and forward throw can tech chase at the same percentages. Unfortunately, this translates to his throws having very limited use, as all of them apart from down throw are only effective for creating space. This severely limits Mac's options when attempting to utilize throws, and makes them a risky prospect in the first place when combined with his average grab attributes.

Alongside these setbacks, Little Mac is further held back by a slew of exploitable weaknesses. As expected, Mac's weak air mobility and high falling speed make him incredibly susceptible to gimps from meteor smashes, semi-spikes, and even footstool jumps, especially if he doesn't have his double jump. Compounding this, his directional air dodge has the least distance in the game, and his air dodge's ending lag is only average relative to the cast due to the universal changes to air dodges, since the ending lag depends on the character's falling speed and gravity. Thus, it is not only a situational option while in a disadvantaged state, but also poor as a normal recovery move. Mac can grab the ledge by using a directional air dodge if he is close enough, however, allowing him to cover the remaining distance to the ledge, making it very useful if combined with his double jump and special moves. His special moves are also considerably less effective while in the air. Straight Lunge loses much of its power when used in midair, and its long charge time makes it impractical for recovery. Aerial KO Uppercut is also significantly weaker and blockable, although it still has both KO and Recovery potential. While Jolt Haymaker and Rising Uppercut are Little Mac's most effective aerial KO options, they are very poor for recovery, offering poor travel distance, small edge sweet spots, and minimal intangibility. Jolt Haymaker does not cause helplessness, allowing Mac to follow up with a wall jump, directional air dodge or Rising Uppercut; however, it travels a mediocre distance and can only be used once before landing or grabbing the edge, leaving Mac one of the most vulnerable characters to edge-guarding as he is unable to use it again if he gets hit. Rising Uppercut loses roughly half its travel distance when used in midair, and while aerial Slip Counter can be a good response to an edge-guard attempt and get Little Mac back on stage, it loses its intangibility, can be predicted, and its end lag if unsuccessful is likely to result in Mac self-destructing or getting gimped by the opponent if used at a low enough altitude. As a result, it is most beneficial to attempt to recover horizontally, rather than vertically, which is nearly impossible depending on if Mac is merely launched, or (semi-)spiked. These traits result in Little Mac having more difficulty with recovering than most other characters, being commonly cited as one of, if not the worst, recovery of the cast overall. While his below-average gravity and high falling speed grant solid vertical endurance for a lightweight, they also make him very vulnerable to combos and juggling. Additionally, the super armor granted by Mac's smash attacks still causes him to take full damage and must be timed carefully to avoid being punished. These traits make Mac extremely prone to momentum shifts; his lacking air game and overall frailty allows opponents to easily combo or even zero-to-death him after one mistake, even if Mac was otherwise dominating the match.

Because of these issues, his neutral game, while decent, is predictable, and while he has a good approach due to his excellent mobility, Mac relies more heavily than most other characters on his shield and dodges for avoiding damage and general positioning, both of which can be predicted and easily punished if overused. His short range can be problematic against characters with long or disjointed attacks. While these issues can be mitigated with Mac's impressive ground speed, he also has trouble dealing with camping; his super armor and special moves provide options for dealing with projectiles, but he is still forced to approach, as he lacks projectiles of his own. His short jumps and weak aerial attacks also leave Mac especially vulnerable to platform camping, arguably more so than any other character in the game. While Mac is very effective at tech chasing due to his high ground speed, forward throw and wide, semi-spiking down smash, his combo potential is otherwise underwhelming, which combined with his linear neutral can sometimes make it difficult to safely rack up damage despite his attacks' high damage output. As a whole, Little Mac's poor combo game and lack of true KO confirms require him to win neutral exchanges more often in order to succeed, especially when trying to close out a stock since his most reliable KO options cannot be comboed into effectively at higher percentages outside of Jolt Haymaker or Rising Uppercut. Players must also be careful and know when to attack and play defensively, or else Little Mac could quickly lose the neutral game, and find themselves at a significant disadvantage.","Overall, Little Mac excels with a very specific, methodical playstyle that is reminiscent of a real-life boxer; a defensive bait and punish style, that entails keeping constant control of the middle of the stage, capitalizing on the opponent's mistakes, staying on the ground as much as possible, and utilizing his excellent ground mobility to his advantage. Because of his polarizing strengths and weaknesses, players must reach a higher than average level of play than most other fighters in order to use Little Mac effectively: he can be difficult to utilize despite his straightforward fighting style, as his severe disadvantage state forces him to play extremely carefully, despite his high mobility and power. Players must learn to utilize Little Mac's long rolls, fast air and fall speed, and super armor on smash attacks to approach projectile-based opponents, and take advantage of his powerful ground tools to condition opponents to make mistakes."
Ganondorf,11,1.467,"Ganondorf is ranked dead last on the tier list, at 82nd out of 82, and is the only character in the E- tier. This is a slight drop from his already very low placement in Smash 4, where he was tied with Zelda at 52nd/53rd out of 54, and gives him the dubious distinction of being the only character ranked last for the NTSC and European tier lists of two different games, the other being Brawl. Despite this, it should be noted that his placement does not equate to the same level of unviability as in previous games, as he is overall more viable than in Brawl and Smash 4.

As with tradition, Ganondorf possesses one of the hardest-hitting movesets in the game, with noteworthy improvements to his raw power over previous games; this makes him one of the most formidable fighters when it comes to KOing. In addition, many of his infamously weak moves have been buffed to be more effective; Dark Dive is now a capable out of shield and KO option, Grounded Wizard's Foot's sweetspot and sourspots have been reversed and make it effective for KOing, and up tilt is significantly faster. Finally, Ganondorf now has access to his sword from the SpaceWorld 2000 GameCube Tech Demo, which provides him with extremely powerful and wide-arced smash attacks that easily KO below 100%, with forward smash being one of the strongest in the game, and up smash being able to cover an entire platform above him and hit ledge hangs with the front hit. Overall, Ganondorf still excels at what he does best: ending stocks in a few hits.

However, Ganondorf's core weaknesses continue to hold him back drastically compared to the rest of the roster. His terrible frame data and slow movement give him severe difficulty in approaching and escaping disadvantage, which is especially problematic due to Ultimate's emphasis on faster-paced and projectile-focused combat. His shield safety is lacking despite his high shield pressure, while his grab and throws are still extremely weak despite his overall power, having short range and being unable to KO easily. Several of his moves also have small or poorly placed hitboxes which results in poor range (with hitbox adjustments making some of them worse than previously) or glaring blindspots (with some such as Dark Dive having worse hitboxes than Falcon Dive, its equivalent move from Captain Falcon). His recovery is among the worst in the game due to Dark Dive's low distance, and despite it not causing helplessness when it connects, opponents are able to slowly gimp Ganondorf simply by getting grabbed deliberately to push him backwards. Finally, changes to his kit remove some of his only situational moves that allow him to play mindgames: his new up smash is no longer able to bait reactions nor is safe on shield if spaced, up aerial's shorter duration makes gimping with the late hitbox more difficult, and aerial Flame Choke can now be escaped by button mashing while also KOing Ganondorf first if used as a sacrificial KO.

Overall, Ganondorf's issues collectively give him significant problems in the neutral game: the majority of the roster can outspeed him in almost every degree, his offstage survivability is extremely poor and limited to air dodge mix-ups, while his strengthened power does not help him approach nor give him many options to defend himself, resulting in him struggling to make use of his excellent raw power and KO ability. Because of these factors, while the community had high hopes for Ganondorf in the early metagame, his competitive reception plummeted as the metagame evolved and his weaknesses became much more exploitable, and he has sat at the very bottom of the first two official tier lists.","Ganondorf is the epitome of the super heavyweight archetype: he is the fifth heaviest character in the game and possesses extreme power in exchange for terrible mobility and frame data. Despite his high traction, above average falling speed, and moderately high gravity, he sports the seventh slowest walking speed, the fourth slowest dashing speed, the third slowest air speed, the sixth lowest air acceleration, and sixth lowest jump and double jump heights. As a result, he is among the least mobile characters in the game, but his high weight grants him exceptional endurance, allowing him to survive at very high percentages and benefit from rage.","Ganondorf's most defining trait is his incredible kill power and damage output. Most of his moves inflict over 10% damage and are capable of killing under 100% with ease, even from the middle of Final Destination, giving him one of the strongest punishment games in the roster. His forward tilt and down smash are very powerful semi-spikes, while his forward and up smashes are massive disjoints that utilize a large sword to cover Ganondorf. In particular, these two smash attacks can not only hit below the ledge, but the former is generally the third strongest of its kind in the game, having the potential to KO most opponents well below 65% (even at the center of Final Destination). His neutral special, Warlock Punch, has the most startup out of his entire moveset, but it also deals ludicrous knockback and damage (especially when B-reversed in the air), being capable of instantaneously killing middleweights and lighter (if it connects before touching the ground). Ganondorf’s sweetspotted down aerial and aerial Wizard's Foot are extremely powerful meteor smashes that can KO opponents offstage at exceptionally low percents. Thanks to his strength, Ganondorf has among the highest KO potential in the game, as he can rack up heavy damage and KO opponents in very few hits.

Ganondorf's shield-breaking capabilities are potent and fearsome. His aforementioned forward and up smashes, Warlock Punch, and aerial Wizard's Foot can bring shields down to a sliver of health, while his Volcano Kick (up tilt) has vacuum properties, deceptively large reach, and can shatter shields in a single hit. These options also allow Ganondorf to play mindgames to make opponents with low shield health play more carefully around him, as he can punish any mistake extremely hard. As such, mistiming or overusing shields against Ganondorf can be deadly, as his aforementioned powerful moves allow him to capitalize shield breaks.

Despite his power, Ganondorf has excellent combo starters, some of which are potential kill confirms. His down throw can combo into every aerial except down aerial or dash attack up to mid-percentages. His dash attack is versatile; not only does it possess extreme KO power at high percentages, being the third strongest dash attack in Ultimate, but its early hit can potentially lead into neutral aerial, up aerial, or Dark Dive at early percentages. Even better, it has a late hit sourspot that grants followups into neutral attack, forward tilt, grab, all aerials except down aerial, and grounded Dark Dive, with the latter two options being potential kill confirms at high percentages. Neutral aerial's set knockback on the first kick as well as the late hit of the second kick can lead into neutral attack, grab, forward tilt, down tilt, or dash attack right after landing on the ground. Sweetspotted down aerial's high hitstun combos into neutral attack, grab, forward tilt, down tilt, every aerial, up smash, or down smash up to middle percentages. Perhaps Ganondorf's best combo starter is grounded Flame Choke, which is is a command grab that meteor smashes opponents into the ground, leading into a myriad of followups and reads. These follow ups include, but are not limited to: neutral attack, forward tilt, down tilt, dash attack, grounded or aerial Wizard’s Foot, any smash attacks or aerials, or even another Flame Choke. While Flame Choke can be teched, its low ending lag allows Ganondorf to tech-chase with the move, with some followups hitting short-distanced techs such as forward tilt covering Bowser's inward tech, up smash or turnaround down smash on Snake's inward tech, down tilt on Inkling's tech away, or neutral attack on all of Piranha Plant's tech options. Some characters can even be trapped at the ledge, where they move no distance from tech away and are hit during their neutral and inward techs.

All of Ganondorf's aerials are very useful, as they are fast despite their immense power (excluding forward aerial and down aerial), and are guaranteed to knock opponents off the stage even at medium percents, giving him a great edgeguarding game. His sweetspotted down aerial is his most damaging aerial and the second strongest meteor smash in the game, and when sourspotted has the second strongest horizontal knockback out of all his aerials (after his sweetspotted back aerial). His up aerial is his lowest damaging aerial, but is his second fastest aerial, can autocancel from a short hop, and its late hitbox is a very potent gimp with its semi-spike angle and high hitstun. His neutral aerial has the lowest knockback out of all his aerials, but is his fastest aerial consisting of two hits that naturally combo into each other with damage rivaling his sweetspotted down aerial, while doubling as long-lasting sex kicks, and has the greatest horizontal reach out of all his aerials allowing it to wall out approaches. His forward aerial boasts good reach in an arc that also hits slightly behind him, while his back aerial is a deceptively fast KO move that can autocancel from a short hop. Aerial Flame Choke is a chokeslam that lacks guaranteed followups, but does more damage than when used on the ground and can still tech-chase. Aerial Wizard's Foot is Ganondorf's only aerial option with vertical knockback, making it a good anti-air that punishes juggles. Finally, Dark Dive is a command grab that does multiple weak electric hits that make it difficult to interrupt, which leads into a very powerful throw that can reverse edgeguard situations, especially when facing away from the stage, while also not causing helplessness and letting him reuse the move; if the grab misses, the move performs an uppercut at the end to deter potential edgeguards.","In spite of his strengths, Ganondorf has glaring flaws. He is highly vulnerable to combos and juggling thanks to his heavy weight, very large size, above average falling speed and gravity, and low air speed, and his slow mobility hinders his approach and ability to close distance or create space. His lack of a projectile or reflector also leaves him susceptible to projectile camping and zoning.

Arguably Ganondorf's biggest weakness is his lack of defensive options, courtesy of the issues within his moveset. To begin, his frame data is very sluggish and among the worst in the game: he has very few moves that are active before frame 9 (these being neutral attack, neutral aerial, up aerial, and standing grab) and some not even coming out before frame 28 (such as forward smash, Warlock Punch, and Volcano Kick), along with many of his moves having extremely high ending lag (most notably all of his smash attacks and all his special moves). As a result of his abysmal frame data, many of his moves are unsafe on shield unless fully spaced, despite his aforementioned shield breaking capabilities. Combined with his poor mobility, Ganondorf struggles to compete with faster characters like Fox, slow projectile users like Ivysaur, and long-ranged characters like Simon and Min Min. This forces Ganondorf's offense to heavily rely on proper spacing and mindgames.

In contrast to Ganondorf's tall size, some of his attacks have poor reach and often have problematic hitbox placements, causing them to have noticeably large blind spots. His neutral attack, forward tilt, back aerial, Dark Dive, and Wizard's Foot, some of which are considered Ganondorf's fastest attacks and best out of shield options, all suffer from a combination of short reach, short hitbox duration, small hitbox sizes, and/or high hitbox placements. Wizard's Foot and Flame Choke also have their hitboxes end earlier than their animations suggest, while forward aerial and back aerial's hitboxes do not properly match their trails. Neutral aerial's two hits often fail to link properly, especially against grounded opponents, likely resulting in Ganondorf getting punished if he whiffs the second hit, and the second hit itself is difficult to land due to its high hitbox placement. His forward smash, despite its impressive reach, completely lacks any active hitboxes during the downward swing, giving it a notoriously large dead zone above and in front of his head. His up smash has a blindspot directly in front of him, and its rear hitboxes end just above the ground. Ganondorf's numerous blind spots allows many small characters such as Pichu to easily exploit and weave through his attacks, especially when crouching.

Ganondorf's grab game is also lackluster. His grab reach is notoriously short despite his tall stature, and, outside of down throw, his throws have little to no followup potential. None of them are consistently viable KO options either, despite dealing respectable amounts of damage; while his forward and back throws deal passable knockback, even they are rather weak and can't KO middleweights under 200% from center stage, while his up throw lacks KO potential altogether. His down throw, despite being a decent combo starter, loses much of its combo potential very quickly past low percentages. The ability to tech Flame Choke at any percentage works against Ganondorf, as it forces hard reads, and incorrect reads can put Ganondorf in a vulnerable position. Flame Choke also lacks a collateral hitbox, allowing doubles, Ice Climbers, and Rosalina & Luma to hit him out of the move.

The other major weakness is his poor recovery, which is considered to be one of the worst in the game. Ganondorf's slow air speed and low jump height, as well as the helplessness-causing Flame Choke and Dark Dive having low speed and resilience, makes his off-stage movement linear and predictable while leaving him very vulnerable to edgeguards and gimps. His recovery specials also work against Ganondorf; aerial Flame Choke can be escaped by button mashing and KOs Ganondorf first when used as a sacrificial KO, while Dark Dive's throw can be teched and punished in its endlag. As such, it's possible to edgeguard Ganondorf by even intentionally getting hit by his aerial specials, leaving him in a position where his abysmal mobility prevents him from recovering.

Ganondorf also has considerable trouble landing safely. Despite his aerials having relatively low landing lag, the aforementioned poor hitbox placements fail to properly defend him from directly underneath, while down aerial and Wizard's Foot have noticeable start-up. While Wizard's Foot is Ganondorf's fastest option to return to the ground and can anti-air intercepting opponents with its vertical knockback, its landing possesses a small and very brief quake along with large landing lag, making it highly punishable.","Overall, Ganondorf's raw power allows him to deal heavy damage quickly and close stocks early, but he has little means to defend himself which forces him to play cautiously, enforcing a bait-and-punish playstyle. His playstyle is a high risk, high reward character: a single mistake can lead to either player losing a stock, even at 0%. He cannot afford to make any careless mistakes himself, where his exploitable recovery allows his opponents to remove his stocks just as early as he can remove theirs."
