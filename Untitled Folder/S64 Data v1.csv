Character,Tier,Tier Score,Quick Summary
Pikachu,S,1.1,"Pikachu ranks 1st on the tier list, its best placement in the series due to having many overwhelming advantages: its mobility is among the best, with fast walking, dashing, and air speeds, though its falling speed is slightly below average. Pikachu is notable for its amazing offstage and edgeguarding game, with fast and powerful aerials that can also combo well with or without certain other moves, along with a recovery on Quick Attack that covers a long distance while also being unpredictable, as well as having some invincibility frames and the ability to easily sweetspot the edge. While its attacks are generally fast, it has a few rather powerful moves, though its moveset is overall more combo-oriented. This is evident in its solid ground game, with an up tilt that can rack up large damage by chaining into itself and can easily combo into virtually any other move as well, along with powerful smash attacks and an exceedingly powerful back throw. It also has a projectile in its Thunder Jolt, as well as Thunder, which is notable for being able to KO near the upper blast line very early; the Thunderspike technique can easily set this up. However, Pikachu is not flawless. It has low weight, allowing for it to be KOed earlier than most of the characters, and can also be easily comboed by others. Pikachu also has limited options out of a tech. Despite this, Pikachu's strengths exceed its weaknesses, and it has held the best tournament results in competitive play, alongside good representation. Pikachu's prowess in Smash 64 is considered undisputed to such a great extent that it is considered to have the best matchup spread of any character in the game, with Pikachu's only potentially difficult matchups being against Captain Falcon and Yoshi which are typically considered to either be even or slightly winning for Pikachu in the North American version of the game."
Kirby,S,2.18,"Kirby ranks 2nd on the current tier list and is his best tier placement in the series. Kirby has strong, fast attacks that can KO at damages below 100%, such as his forward smash, and he has a great edgeguarding game, due to his long recovery and powerful aerials, particularly his down aerial. Kirby also has several methods to space against opponents, with his back aerial and forward aerial having large disjointed hitboxes that have significant combo potential, and his up tilt is notably considered one of the best attacks in the game due to its large range, high speed, good combo ability, and ability to break shields. However, Kirby's primary weakness consists of his recovery. Despite being long-distanced, he has few options for returning to the stage, creating a slow, linear recovery that can be easily intercepted. Furthermore, Kirby's combination of having a light weight and being rather floaty makes him vulnerable to juggling and vertical KOs. Kirby's combo game is also predictable against certain characters, being reliant on solely his up tilt and forward aerial on such characters, and these two attacks do not complement each other very well. Regardless of these weaknesses, Kirby's strengths outweigh his weaknesses by a considerable margin, and he has had very strong tournament results alongside above-average representation."
Captain Falcon,A,3.42,"Captain Falcon is ranked 3rd overall on the tier list for his overall very quick movement speed (despite a slow walking speed, he has the fastest dashing and falling speeds in the game, and an average air speed) and very strong combo ability, with his up aerial being an especially useful move that can combo in a huge variety of ways, including being able to lead into another up aerial or a forward aerial for aerial combos, as well as a Falcon Dive or down aerial as a combo finisher. Along with powerful edgeguarders in his back aerial and up aerial semi-spike, and an effective meteor smash with a very long duration in his down aerial, this gives Falcon a strong aerial game. His combo game isn't limited to the air, thanks to his up smash and forward throw that can easily setup other moves due to their low knockback. His combos involving aerials, up smash, and forward throw are able to 0-death many characters without much difficulty. Captain Falcon also has strong vertical endurance and is overall fairly difficult to KO onstage. Captain Falcon's primary weaknesses include his vulnerability to combos from many characters due to his very fast falling speed and high weight and size. His ground game is also much more limited than his air game, due to him lacking options on the ground outside up smash, forward smash, grab, and neutral attack, as well as having somewhat limited out of shield options. He is also highly vulnerable to edgeguarding, due to his large size and subpar recovery, due to it being predictable, as his primary recovery move, Falcon Dive, gives short horizontal and vertical distance, while also being unable to grab edgehoggers, and his very fast falling speed hindering it further. Additionally, Captain Falcon lacks a projectile and a reliable way to deal with them, making characters like Fox difficult to deal with. Regardless, Captain Falcon's strengths noticeably outweigh his flaws, and he has some of the highest representation and results of any character. He ranks higher in the NTSC-U than in the NTSC-J Japanese version due to him being buffed, to the point where in the Japanese version he ranks 4th on the tier list."
Fox,A,3.75,"Fox ranks 4th on the tier list, mainly due to his very quick movement speed and versatile combo ability. He has the second fastest dashing and falling speeds in the game, along with the fastest walking speed, and the third fastest air speed, allowing him to get around very quickly, which not only helps with evading opponents, but also to get around during combos. His combo moves typically include his up tilt, down tilt, down aerial, the first hit of his neutral attack, etc. He is able to rack up damage in a variety of ways such as up tilt chains and repeated down aerial to down tilt chains. Fox is known for his Blaster Shot, among the best projectiles in the game for numerous reasons - its hitstun allows Fox to effortlessly counter opponent approaches, while it also helps him approach. The lag of the move can also be avoided using the techniques short hop laser and ledgehopped double laser. While the majority of Fox's moves are low power, combo-orientated moves, he does have high power attacks such as his up smash and up aerial. Fox additionally has multiple quick, low power aerials which can easily combo offstage and reliably edgeguard opponents, along with an effective semi-spike in his down smash and a set knockback semi-spike in his shine, notable for the shine spike technique. However, Fox does have some weaknesses. He has an over-reliance on his up smash and up aerial for onstage KOs, and his only reliable way to finish off the opponent outside those moves is edgeguarding. His other onstage moves are either generally lacking in power, predictable, inferior to up smash and up aerial, or all of the above. Fox is additionally a vulnerable character to combos - despite his moderate weight and size, his fast falling speed makes him vulnerable to characters such as Pikachu and Kirby, who can easily get Fox offstage, where his predictable and linear recovery, along with his fast falling speed, puts him in a bad position offstage. With the banning of Hyrule Castle, Fox has slightly dropped in the most recent tier list, since it is more difficult to camp on Dream Land, the only legal stage, due to its smaller size. Regardless of these weaknesses, Fox's strengths outweigh them by quite a margin, having great matchups, as well as strong tournament representation and results. He also ranks slightly higher in the Japanese tier list at 3rd."
Yoshi,A,4.85,"Yoshi currently ranks 5th in the tier list, placing him in the A tier. Yoshi is known for having unique properties compared to the other characters in the game: his shield—which is an egg rather than the standard energy bubble—doesn't shrink, making him completely immune to shield stabbing, allowing parrying techniques, and also lasts slightly longer than the normal shield. In addition, his midair jump gives him a type of armor throughout its duration, allowing him to escape combos and even hit back. Yoshi's stats are rather unique as well; despite him having above average weight, he has decent dashing speed and the fastest air speed in the game. Yoshi's down aerial is the most effective damage racking move in the game, dealing a maximum of 56% damage, while landing the move is made even easier using the double jump cancel technique, which can also be applied to his other useful aerials. His forward aerial is an effective meteor smash with very quick startup yet high power, along with the ability to combo into it with moves such as forward tilt. Yoshi has useful combo options outside this, including a versatile up tilt that can juggle fastfallers or heavyweights at any percent due to having set knockback, and lead into an aerial or up smash, with a late-hitting neutral aerial being able to followup with another up tilt to continue the combo. However, Yoshi's above average weight and size make him rather easy for quicker characters (such as Pikachu and Fox) to combo. In addition, his grab is very slow and punishable, yet having limited range compared to other tether grabs. Yoshi also lacks a rising up special to recover, forcing him to use his double jump, meaning that if he flinches out of his double jump, he will be unable to recover. Yoshi's biggest problems, however, are his huge difficulties dealing with pressure, especially shield pressure, as well as lacking reliable approach options with considerable range, making it very easy for characters with disjointed moves (most particularly Kirby's up tilt) to simply outspace him constantly. Yoshi's properties give him balanced matchups, with his matchup spread having an average of 50:50. He generally has trouble against higher tiered characters, but can do well against lower tiered characters, though he has a handful of even matchups against characters near or below him on the tier list. However, because of the results and representation other characters have had, as well as Yoshi being buffed on international releases of the game, he is ranked 10th in the Japanese tier list, where he has mostly below-average matchups, though unlike the NTSC version, he is considered a hard counter against Luigi."
Jigglypuff,B,6.46,"Jigglypuff ranks 6th, right in the middle of the tier list, in the B tier. It is notable for being the lightest, floatiest, and lowest gravity character in the game. Jigglypuff has many low knockback attacks, which when combined with its floatiness, can be abused to its advantage in several combos against heavier characters, especially by gimping them or carrying them all the way to the lateral blast lines. It also has some moves with disproportionate power, like its up smash, back throw, and the famous Rest. However, because Jigglypuff is so light and floaty, it is very easy to KO. In addition, Jigglypuff lacks a rising up special move for recovery, forcing it to rely on its remaining midair jumps and Pound to recover. Jigglypuff's pros are considered to be on par with its flaws, and because of this, it has some favorable to even matchups in the current metagame, and has achieved above average tournament representation and results. However, Jigglypuff ranks worse in Japan at 8th, due to the higher strengths some other characters have in comparison to Jigglypuff."
Mario,B,6.49,"Mario ranks 7th on the tier list, in the B tier. As an all-rounder character, Mario generally has a great balance of offensive and defensive capabilities. He has a strong combo game, including a versatile down aerial (that can easily lead into an up aerial to continue the combo, an up smash as a finisher, or itself offstage to drag opponents down) and his up tilt (which can chain into itself at moderately low to moderate percentages), as well as among the best edgeguarding abilities, with powerful forward and back aerials that can also space against opponents easily, down aerial meteor smash with extremely low set knockback, and a powerful down smash that can easily cover edge options and rolls. To further compliment his offstage game, he also has one of the few good recoveries in the game; despite a moderate falling speed and low air speed, his Super Jump Punch gains some good distance while being relatively quick, and he also has an additional option in his Mario Tornado, which can even meteor smash a careless edgeguarder on the last hit. Mario has numerous additional tools, including a projectile in his Fireball, a very powerful finisher in his up smash, and useful throws, with his back throw being especially powerful. Mario, however, has limited range compared to characters tiered higher than him, with issues in the hitboxes of his tilts and aerials. He also has poor mobility, with subpar walking and dashing speeds, and a low air speed, also slightly limiting his combo ability. In addition to this, his recovery, despite being good, is on the more predictable side against most characters, with his Super Jump Punch and Mario Tornado traveling in a linear way that isn't too difficult to attack out of. Overall, Mario has the tools to take on any character. He is also considered to be slightly better in the Japanese version due to the changes to SDI."
Samus,C,9.28,"She is ranked 8th on the current tier list, placing her at the top of the C tier. Samus is a heavy, yet floaty, character with decent horizontal recovery. She has arguably the highest raw damage output in the game, courtesy of her many options for attacking, and due to the long range of her moves, she is able to space them well. The high damage output of her moves also translates well to her power, having many powerful finishers like her Charge Shot and her neutral and back aerials. Despite her weight, her floaty nature also allows her to not be comboed as easily as others. However, Samus has many glaring weaknesses. One of them is her overall slow mobility: while she has a fast dashing speed, she is among the least mobile characters in the air due to her floatiness. Samus also has no reliable grounded or aerial options for approaching. Another weakness is her very sluggish frame data, with some of her moves having lots of ending lag. Altogether, this gives her an almost non-existent approach. While she seemingly has many combo starters due to said moves having low knockback, she has a low amount of combos due to her moves' ending lag. Lastly, she lacks a quick and easy-to-land KO move and relies on reads and predictable finishers to KO. However, she is ranked higher in the Japanese version at 7th, due to the different gameplay mechanics having an impact on her moveset, and she has a notable smasher in Jouske, who achieves great results with her (despite refusing to travel to North America)."
Donkey Kong,C,9.49,"Donkey Kong is currently ranked 9th out of 12 on the tier list, which is his worst placement in the series. He has powerful moves such as his aforementioned Giant Punch which when fully charged, deals 36% damage. He also sports an infamously abusable grab release, remarkable reach throughout his moveset, and is the heaviest character in the game, making him very difficult to KO, especially vertically. However, he is somewhat slow, and is also the largest character in the game, which coupled with his heavy weight makes him an easy target for combos. Despite his incredible endurance, his off-stage survivability is almost non-existent, as he has among the worst vertical-distanced recovery moves in the game. Despite this, Donkey Kong was indirectly buffed in the international releases thanks to the changes to SDI system as well as the decreased shield stun. As a result, Donkey Kong is ranked 12th in the Japanese tier list, having a losing matchup against every character in the game, especially against Kirby, which is considered to be virtually unwinnable."
Ness,C,10.02,"Ness ranks 10th on the tier list, the third lowest ranked character. He is well-known for his unique double jump and technical movement: he, along with Yoshi, can cancel their double jump with an attack, granting him a burst of speed he can use to move and attack extremely quickly. Ness's fast movement combined with his powerful aerials give him a strong and flexible combo game. He's able to both juggle and tech chase his opponent, frequently using his up tilt and up air as launchers to setup a down air spike onto a platform. After building up damage, Ness has many ways to finish opponents, including kill throws, multiple high knockback aerials, and strong smash attacks. Although his weaknesses are few in number they can be easily exploitable. His long distanced recovery is hindered by being slow, predictable, and easy to interrupt, leaving him one of the easiest characters in the game to gimp. Although his double jump cancel gives him very fast horizontal movement, his slowness in the air can make it very difficult to deal with vertical camping, especially from characters with strong down aerials like Kirby or Jigglypuff. The low range of most of his aerials compounds this weakness and can make it difficult to approach characters with better disjoint. As a result, despite his strengths he has poor matchups and low tournament representation and results. Conversely, Ness is ranked 5th on the Japanese tier list because he is much stronger in the Japanese version, rather than the international release, in which he was nerfed."
Link,C,10.33,"Link is currently ranked 11th on the tier list, the second lowest ranked character, outranking only Luigi. His placement in Smash 64 is also tied with his later iteration in Brawl as his worst placement in the series. Link is known in high level competitive play as a very defensive character, relying on bombs and Boomerangs to prevent gimps and using his up tilt and up and back aerials for combos, while using his forward and down smash, down aerial, and projectiles for edgeguarding. Having many disjointed melee attacks and his aforementioned two projectiles, Link can be a hassle to approach, while also having an average approach himself courtesy of his extremely high traction. However, his lack of speed and maneuverability limit his ability to safely approach. As a result, Link's game plan is largely attacking from afar with thrown projectiles and waiting for an opening. Due to his slow ground movement and attacks, it is imperative for Link players to be able to not only short hop but be able to input an attack immediately afterward. Link's recovery is awful, and widely considered to be one of the worst recoveries in the series, making offstage play very risky. He is also very easy to combo due to his weight and being a fast faller. Link's recovery and combo vulnerability make many of his matchups difficult. Link is slightly better in the PAL version due to having faster air speed (improving his recovery and some of his combo ability), and his forward smash dealing 4% more damage, and much better in the Japanese version where he is ranked 9th on the tier list, due to Link's up tilt having more reliable combo ability and sending opponents on a more favorable angle to combo, as well as his bombs being much easier to use in combos. Regardless, he has poor matchups on the NTSC-U version, and poor results due to his small playerbase."
Luigi,C,11.67,"Luigi ranks 12th on the tier list, placing him at the bottom of the C tier and the entire tier list itself and is his worst tier placement in the series. Luigi's combo ability is varied and versatile, and they can be followed by his most devastating finisher, the Super Jump Punch. He also has a long distanced recovery. However, his weaknesses are extremely overwhelming: he has very slow movement speed, with the slowest traction, dashing, and air speeds, along with the third lowest falling speed and gravity. Despite the latter attribute giving him great jumping prowess, it also gives him a high short hop. Like Mario, his reach is poor, giving him trouble at hitting opponents. Altogether, these attributes result in very weak and almost complete lack of offensive options in the neutral game, despite having Fireball as a projectile. While being a clone in terms of attacks, some of his attacks are much weaker, an exception to it being Super Jump Punch, which is hard to land without confirming a combo into it. Lastly, his recovery is predictable despite being long distanced, and he is easier to gimp because of his lower air speed. As a result of these attributes, he has almost no dedicated players in competitive play, and suffers from poor tournament results."
